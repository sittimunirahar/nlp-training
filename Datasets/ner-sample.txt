{"text": "Bangladesh would consider an out-of-court settlement with a bank in the Philippines over $81 million stolen from its accounts in New York by hackers who wired the money to Manila, Bangladesh central bank officials said on Thursday. In one of the world's biggest cyber heists, the hackers stole the Bangladesh Bank money held at the New York Fed in February 2016 using fraudulent orders on the SWIFT payments system and sent it to Rizal Commercial Banking Corp . From there, it disappeared into the casino industry in the Philippines. No one has been charged for the heist despite an international investigation and two years of finger-pointing among Bangladesh, Philippines, the Fed and SWIFT. There is an option before us to settle the issue out of court, a senior official at Bangladesh's central bank told Reuters. The official, who declined to be identified, cited as a precedent an out-of-court settlement in February reached by Ecuador's Banco del Austro and Wells Fargo over a 2015 cyber heist. Bangladesh's Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith on Thursday met Carlos Dominguez, Finance Secretary of the Philippines, on the sidelines of a four-day annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank in Manila to discuss the cyber heist, said two senior central bank officials close to the issue. Bangladesh is yet to take legal action but had planned a suit to recover $66 million. Around $15 million has been recovered from a Manila junket operator, a job that involves marketing casinos to VIPs. We will try for all possible options to recover our stolen money, the officials added. There was no immediate comment from Dominguez or Rizal bank in Manila.", "labels": [[72, 83, "GPE"], [89, 100, "MONEY"], [129, 137, "GPE"], [172, 178, "GPE"], [222, 230, "DATE"], [235, 238, "CARDINAL"], [298, 313, "ORG"], [328, 344, "ORG"], [348, 361, "DATE"], [393, 398, "ORG"], [430, 459, "ORG"], [521, 532, "GPE"], [615, 624, "DATE"], [650, 660, "GPE"], [662, 673, "GPE"], [679, 682, "ORG"], [687, 692, "ORG"], [782, 792, "ORG"], [813, 820, "ORG"], [918, 926, "DATE"], [938, 945, "GPE"], [948, 964, "ORG"], [969, 980, "ORG"], [988, 992, "DATE"], [1036, 1058, "PERSON"], [1062, 1070, "DATE"], [1075, 1091, "PERSON"], [1093, 1100, "ORG"], [1118, 1129, "GPE"], [1153, 1161, "DATE"], [1162, 1168, "DATE"], [1180, 1206, "ORG"], [1210, 1216, "GPE"], [1250, 1253, "CARDINAL"], [1377, 1388, "MONEY"], [1390, 1408, "MONEY"], [1435, 1441, "GPE"], [1633, 1651, "ORG"], [1660, 1666, "GPE"]]}

We cannot say he is dead when there is no body, proof or information to verify the (local) reports. “We have requested information from the Ivorian government but there has been no response so far.

Quoting the Justice Minister Jeannot Kouadio Ahoussou, the African media reported that the bodies of the four men were believed to have been wrapped in black plastic bags similar to those used to package bananas, before being thrown into a lagoon. The revelation was made following the arrest of the abductors. Two remains were subsequently found, but only Lambelin was positively identified. Pandian and Adeossi are still listed as missing.

Asst Supt Mohd Zulkifly Mohd Isa, 31, from Bukit Aman, testified that he received two BlackBerry 9700 handphones for analysis from investigating officer ASP Ishak Yaakob on Sept 17 last year. It was earlier testified that two black and white BlackBerry handphones, belonging to bank officer Noorhisham Mohammad and lawyer Ahmad Kamil Abdul Karim respectively, were recovered at a water lock near the Banting wet market. Both Noorhisham and Ahmad Kamil went missing with Sosilawati and her driver Kamaruddin Shamsuddin on Aug 30, 2010, after telling their families and friends that they were going to Banting to discuss a land deal.

He is alleged to have seriously injured a friend, Ashvin Danny Holtkamp, 24, on his left eye with a glass mug at Club 21, Bangsar Shopping Centre in Bangsar between 12am and 12.30am on Dec 4. The charge under Section 326 of the Penal Code carries a maximum 20 years' jail and fine or whipping upon conviction. Prosecuting officer Supt R.Munusamy requested of the court to set bail at RM50,000 in two local sureties and for the accused's passport to be impounded. Sebastian's counsel S.Selva Balan mitigated for the sum to be reduced to RM5,000 and for the accused to keep his passport as he had already booked a flight last Oct 24 to return to Germany to celebrate Christmas with his two children from his ex-wife. He will surrender his passport to the court on the second week of Feb 2012, counsel requested. The court decided in the prosecution's favour and imposed a RM50,000 bail in two local sureties and for the accused to surrender his passport to the court and report to the nearest police station every two weeks until disposal of the case. Nevertheless, Mahmud allowed the defence's application for temporary release of the passport to enable the accused to return to his country on condition he surrendered the document back to the court on or before Feb 1 next year upon returning to Malaysia.

She added that the syndicates would siphon the gas from 12kg or 14kg LPG cylinders meant for domestic consumption and transfer it to 50kg cylinders for resale. “LPG is highly flammable and the transferring of gas is very dangerous and can spark an explosion. “Stern action will be taken against unscrupulous operators.

Tan said the price of a 14kg LPG cylinder was RM49.42, of which RM22.82 of the amount is subsidised by the government. “This means the public only have to pay RM26.60 per cylinder,” she added. In her speech, Tan urged the public to buy their LPG tanks from licensed distributors who adhered to regulations set by the Fire and Rescue Department. She added that the ministry had issued 5,398 retail licences to distribute LPG nationwide.

The instigator was believed to have been envious of the academic achievements of SMK Agama Durian Guling student Wan Nur Azri Wan Mohammad. The eight ended up in the magistrate's court yesterday where they were charged with trespassing into another school as well as beating up the Form Five student. The boys, comprising four Form Five students, three Form Three students and a Form Four student, pleaded guilty to trespassing into Wan Nur Azri's school between 11am and 11.30am on April 7. The offence under Section 447 of the Penal Code carries a RM3,000 fine or six months' jail. They also admitted causing multiple injuries to Wan Nur Azri. They can be jailed up to a year or fined RM2,000 or both under Section 323. According to the facts of the case, Wan Nur Azri was chatting with his friends in the classroom when the eight rushed in. The teacher was not in at that time. He was dragged out and pushed behind a chemistry lab before being assaulted by the group.

Navy Chief Adm Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Jaafar said the submarine, which has been decommissioned, would become a museum piece. “We are expecting its arrival in August. There will be a signing ceremony between the Defence Ministry secretary-general and the French side before it is handed over to us,” he told a press conference here yesterday. On the country's first two submarines KD Tunku Abdul Rahman and KD Tun Razak Adm Abdul Aziz said they were in the open sea and operating smoothly, contrary to reports. He also denied claims that kickbacks were involved over the two Scorpene submarines, adding that neither the European Union nor the RMN condoned such acts. It was announced last month that the submarines would cost RM50mil a year to maintain. On the pirate-infested Gulf of Aden, Adm Abdul Aziz said there could be two RMN auxiliary escort ships guarding Malaysian trading vessels by the end of this year. The second ship, he said, would supplement Bunga Mas 5, which successfully foiled a hijacking attempt against Malaysian MT Bunga Laurel last January. Commandos had captured seven Somali pirates who have since been charged here. Adm Abdul Aziz said assigning Bunga Mas 6 as the second auxiliary ship resulted from continued strategic cooperation between the RMN and the Malaysian International Shipping Corporation (MISC).

{"text": "SEPANG: It is all systems go for tomorrow's 2011 Formula One Petronas Malaysia Grand Prix and while there seem to be fewer promotions this year, Sepang International Circuit (SIC) chairman Datuk Mokhzani Mahathir begs to differ. While other circuits like Singapore focus more on concerts, Malaysia, he said, was doing things “slightly differently” by emphasising on the race itself. Mokhzani said SIC was also giving more opportunities to the private sector and teams to organise their events this year such as street demonstrations by Team Lotus and Red Bull Racing. “Funding has to come from the private sector,” he said, adding that the circuit was ready to host the race with, among others, a free pit walkabout for schoolchildren yesterday and a free concert by Korean artiste Rain tomorrow. Instead of hosting the annual gala dinner, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak met Formula One team principals and drivers along with invited guests at Sri Perdana in Putrajaya on Thursday night. “It is a networking opportunity for the corporate sector, Formula One and the Government,” Mokhzani said. He pointed out that while Singapore had had artistes such as Beyonce and Mariah Carey perform in the past, they were “standalone” concerts which fans paid for separately compared to the free ones SIC hosted for grandstand ticket holders in Malaysia. “We do have quality acts.

{"text": "When the Finance Minister tabled Budget 2013 and reduced personal income tax rate by 1%, some quarters have asked if this brings us one step closer to the GST. EVER grumbled about having to pay the RM50 government tax for your credit card each year? Well, the good news is there will be no more such tax if the proposed GST (goods and services tax) is implemented. And you will pay GST on the credit card only if your bank charges you for the card. “These days, banks are offering credits cards for free and giving waivers on annual subscription. If the card is free, there will be no GST on it,” says Customs Department director-general Datuk Khazali Ahmad in an interview. He stresses that key sectors like the financial services, public transport, healthcare, education and residential housing will be exempt from GST. This essentially means that education, medical care, bus and train tickets as well as highway tolls will still be just as affordable as today. Thus, the lower income groups will not be burdened by the GST. When it comes to insurance, Khazali says, if it is a life policy (including education, investment-linked and endowment), no GST will be imposed. But if it is a general insurance policy for medical, fire, motor, burglary, then the normal GST rate (proposed at 4%) will apply. Despite the GST being a fairer, more effective and transparent taxation system and one that has been successfully implemented in 146 countries, it has not been easy to push the idea through in Malaysia. In fact, the government has been talking about the GST for more than two decades now (even when Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim was the Finance Minister in the 1990s). In December 2009, the GST bill was tabled in parliament for first reading but it was withdrawn on April 19 this year for amendments. The Finance Ministry on its website has asked the public for views and feedback on the proposed GST. With public awareness still very low on how GST works, it might be years before it actually comes to fruition. People are still not aware that their basic needs will be protected under the proposed GST regime because essential food items like rice, meat, fish, seafood, chicken, vegetables, cooking oil and salt will be “zero-rated”, which means there will no GST imposed. Critical services like schools, financial services, hospitals, roads and public transport will be “GST-exempt”, which means the consumer will be exempted from paying GST on them. And if you buy a flight ticket to a destination abroad, you will not have to pay GST. “You will be charged GST only on goods and services (which are not zero or exempt-rated) that you consume in the country what you consume outside the country will not be subject to a local GST. A flight ticket abroad and overseas travel is consumption outside Malaysia, so you don't pay GST here on it,” says Khazali. The GST is a consumption-based tax where the tax is borne by the person who consumes the goods or services. Ultimately, it should reduce business costs because manufacturers, distributors and suppliers are able to claim back the GST they paid on goods and services acquired for the purpose of their business. And these businesses are supposed to pass those savings down to the consumer, which should result in lower prices. Khazali says people find it hard to accept the GST even though it benefits them because “tax” is never a popular subject. “Generally, nobody likes to be taxed or, rather, the word “tax” is taboo to many. “However, governments all over the world need to impose tax to get the revenue to provide their citizens with their social needs, employment, security and so forth.” Educating consumers on the GST, he admits, is not easy because the moment you say that GST is a form of tax, “you will be faced with a wall of resistance”. “So we have to explain the GST and its benefits to the people continuously to avoid or eliminate whatever misconception they have about it,” he adds. Khazali also notes that most people do not know that the GST actually replaces the current sales and services tax which they have already been paying on a lot of goods and services because it is embedded in the price of what they buy. Under the current system, by the time the goods reach the consumers, the sales tax that is paid at the manufacturers level would have cascaded at each level of the distribution and the supply chain, and this results in a higher price. But with the GST, since businesses at every stage are able to get a refund on the GST paid on the goods and services acquired or used for the purpose of their business, this will eliminate the cascading effect suffered under the current sales and services taxes. And because of this, an immediate reduction in prices should be seen for goods and services where people have all along been paying an embedded sales tax. He also stresses that the government has repeatedly emphasised that the people will have to understand the GST first before the government actually implements it. “The public should not have any fear over GST. It is a form of consumption tax which has been implemented in nearly 150 countries in the world, whether developed or developing, so there must be something good about it. “ He says the GST is also supposed to result in cheaper prices for imported goods. At present, unless exempted, imported goods are subject to an import duty and sales tax. With the GST replacing the sales tax (5% to 10%), imported goods will still be subject to an import duty and a GST; but because the proposed GST rate is lower than the existing sales tax, consumers should be paying less. Before implementing the GST too, he says, the government will also educate businesses on the need to pass down the savings they get from the GST refund, and set up a mechanism to stop businesses from trying to profiteer from it. For him, the GST is a good thing because it will reduce business costs, lead to more competitive pricing, make exports more competitive because exports will be zero-rated (meaning no GST), increase gross domestic production and reduce grey economy activities. Khazali also believes there might be a change in consumption pattern with the GST because the GST works on the affordability concept. “Consumers have to decide which goods or services to buy. They pay GST only when the goods or services are consumed. So they may divert more of their expenses towards essential goods and services rather than on luxury goods.” Khazali also points out that if the GST is implemented here at the proposed rate of 4%, it will be the lowest rate in the region. Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos charge a 10% GST rate, Philippines 12% and Singapore 7%. But what is to stop the government from hiking the rate after it has been implemented? Khazali cites past experiences, saying Malaysia increased its sales tax rate only once from 5% in 1972 (year of implementation) to 10% in 1983 and service tax rate too increased only once, from 5% in 1975 (year of implementation) to 6% in 2011. There are still nuts and bolts to sort out with implementing the GST here, including tabling a new bill for it, putting an anti-profiteering mechanism in place, getting public understanding and acceptance on it. For now, it looks like it is still quite a long journey away.", "labels": [[85, 87, "PERCENT"], [89, 102, "CARDINAL"], [132, 135, "CARDINAL"], [155, 158, "ORG"], [160, 164, "ORG"], [239, 248, "DATE"], [320, 323, "ORG"], [382, 385, "ORG"], [602, 620, "ORG"], [638, 657, "PERSON"], [817, 820, "ORG"], [958, 963, "DATE"], [1023, 1026, "ORG"], [1056, 1063, "PERSON"], [1287, 1289, "PERCENT"], [1315, 1318, "ORG"], [1432, 1435, "CARDINAL"], [1496, 1504, "GPE"], [1557, 1560, "ORG"], [1565, 1586, "DATE"], [1602, 1626, "PERSON"], [1655, 1664, "DATE"], [1670, 1683, "DATE"], [1689, 1692, "ORG"], [1727, 1732, "ORDINAL"], [1765, 1783, "DATE"], [1800, 1820, "ORG"], [1945, 1948, "ORG"], [1968, 1973, "DATE"], [2099, 2102, "ORG"], [2222, 2226, "CARDINAL"], [2606, 2610, "CARDINAL"], [2728, 2731, "ORG"], [2799, 2807, "GPE"], [2848, 2855, "PERSON"], [2861, 2864, "ORG"], [3086, 3089, "ORG"], [3281, 3288, "PERSON"], [3328, 3331, "ORG"], [3678, 3681, "ORG"], [3738, 3741, "ORG"], [3834, 3837, "ORG"], [3957, 3964, "PERSON"], [4014, 4017, "ORG"], [4440, 4443, "ORG"], [4509, 4512, "ORG"], [4952, 4955, "ORG"], [5050, 5053, "ORG"], [5117, 5127, "CARDINAL"], [5241, 5244, "ORG"], [5408, 5411, "ORG"], [5437, 5446, "PERCENT"], [5510, 5513, "ORG"], [5644, 5647, "ORG"], [5761, 5764, "ORG"], [5862, 5865, "ORG"], [6009, 6013, "CARDINAL"], [6109, 6116, "PERSON"], [6187, 6190, "ORG"], [6203, 6206, "ORG"], [6469, 6476, "PERSON"], [6505, 6508, "ORG"], [6553, 6555, "PERCENT"], [6599, 6608, "GPE"], [6610, 6618, "GPE"], [6620, 6628, "GPE"], [6630, 6637, "GPE"], [6642, 6646, "GPE"], [6656, 6659, "PERCENT"], [6670, 6681, "GPE"], [6682, 6685, "PERCENT"], [6690, 6699, "GPE"], [6700, 6702, "PERCENT"], [6791, 6798, "PERSON"], [6830, 6838, "GPE"], [6883, 6885, "PERCENT"], [6889, 6893, "DATE"], [6922, 6925, "PERCENT"], [6929, 6933, "DATE"], [6985, 6987, "PERCENT"], [6991, 6995, "DATE"], [7024, 7026, "PERCENT"], [7030, 7034, "DATE"], [7101, 7104, "ORG"]]}
{"text": "WSJ reported on July 3 that US$700 million may have moved through agencies linked to debt-ridden 1MDB and ended up in Malaysia’s Prime Minister Najib Razak's accounts. Najib says he has not taken money for personal gain. — Reuters pic HONG KONG, July 21 — Malaysia Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s biggest source of support—his own party—could also be the most realistic threat to his leadership. As the premier faces an investigation sparked by a Wall Street Journal report that US$700 million (RM2.6 billion) may have wended its way into his personal bank accounts, the ruling coalition has swiftly closed ranks around him. The probe has sparked a raid on the state investment company whose advisory board Najib chairs, and spurred calls to resign from opposition lawmakers and even former premier Tun Mahathir Mohamad. But Najib continues his grip on power with the help of his United Malays National Organisation (Umno), which leads an alliance and has governed Malaysia since 1957. Part of Najib’s staying power reflects a lack of external threats with the opposition bloc recently collapsing amid internal bickering. There are few signs of public discontent over the money trail claims. Internally Najib’s built a support network since coming to power in 2009 that ranges from government ministers to party division heads. He’s rallied rank and file members with a variety of pro-Malay policies in the past 18 months. Najib doubles as finance minister and is also the party chief. The biggest risk would be if party chiefs at some point decide he’s become a potential liability to lead them into the next election, due to be held by 2018, especially as the coalition lost the popular vote for the first time in 2013 as non-Malay voters deserted it. ‘Pockets of dissatisfaction’ “If you are asking me whether there are pockets of dissatisfaction within the party, then the honest answer is of course there is,” said Syed Ali Alhabshee, an Umno division chief in Kuala Lumpur. “But is there a serious division within Umno, which is threatening to split the party? Of course not.” Ibrahim Suffian, an analyst at the Merdeka Center for Opinion Research, said Umno’s chiefs may only move against Najib if discontent spills onto the streets. “Umno division and branch leaders will have to see real public unhappiness with policies before they act,” he said. The Journal reported July 3 that US$700 million may have moved through agencies linked to debt-ridden 1Malaysia Development Bhd. and ended up in Najib’s accounts. Najib says he has not taken money for personal gain. Audit report Controversy over 1MDB’s finances has dogged Najib for months, though an initial audit report this month didn’t reveal any suspicious activity. The probes of 1MDB are now intersecting with the investigation into Najib. “All these accusations against Najib, whether it is by the opposition, by Mahathir and by the foreign media, they are accusations against the party,” said Shahrir Samad, a lawmaker and Umno division leader for Johor Bahru in southern Malaysia. “Everyone is united, defending the party.” Najib’s office didn’t respond to requests for comment. Najib told Malaysians in a July 16 speech to be wary of internal and external threats, including interference from foreign powers that may undermine the country’s stability and sovereignty. There are issues chipping away at the premier’s popularity. Economic growth is slowing and he’s still working to bed down an unpopular goods and services tax. The most recent major opinion poll conducted in January showed his approval rating at 44 per cent from 48 per cent in October, near a record low of 42 per cent at the start of last year. Fading popularity Najib’s predecessor Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi stepped down in 2009 after the coalition lost its two-thirds majority in elections in 2008 — the worst performance since 1969. His popularity within Umno had faded, fuelled in part by resignation calls from Mahathir, whose influence then resonated among party members. But Najib has more support support than Abdullah did. “Najib is entrenched in this Umno-constructed Malay state,” said Clive Kessler, an emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales who has studied Malaysian politics since 1969. “It is a fortress. He can’t be budged from there.” He’s also bought some insurance, postponing party elections scheduled for next year by 18 months. To be removed, more than half the division leaders in the party or two-thirds of the party’s decision-making body must agree to call an extraordinary meeting. At the meeting, two-thirds of those who attend would need to vote for his ouster. ‘Patronage system’ “Malaysia has a patronage system whereby the supreme leader has to take care of major honchos and so as long as he is able to satisfy their various demands and interests, they will rally around him,” said Oh Ei Sun, an analyst at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and Najib’s political secretary from 2009 to 2011. By law, donations to political parties are unlimited and parties aren’t required to report how they spend funds. Umno’s funds are highly disproportionate to other parties, according to Transparency International. The government has made greater use of the Sedition Act and a new anti-terrorism law has elements of security measures repealed in 2012. Police have investigated or charged at least 78 people for sedition since the start of 2014, according to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Website blocked The Sarawak Report news website was this week blocked by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, which said its content could destabilize the country. The site responded that the action was a “blatant attempt to censor” content related to 1MDB. Najib has benefited from the implosion of the opposition bloc after the jailing of leader Anwar Ibrahim on sodomy charges Anwar said were false and politically motivated. Umno’s base is mostly ethnic Malay voters in rural areas where there is a heavy weighting of parliamentary seats. Roughly one in every 10 Malaysians are party members. Najib’s father, former premier Abdul Razak Hussein, crafted a system in the early 1970s to give preferential treatment to Malays and indigenous people, known collectively as Bumiputeras. That system endures today. Cash handouts have bolstered support among lower-income Malaysians representing about 40 per cent of the population, according to National University of Malaysia professor Shamsul Amri Baharuddin. Annual handouts will rise to 950 ringgit (US$250) from 650 ringgit, Najib said in this year’s budget. Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak (left) and Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin at the Perdana Putra building in Putrajaya, July 8, 2015. — File pic Islamic credentials Umno officials are also burnishing their Islamic credentials. Some lawmakers back the efforts of the opposition PAS to introduce shariah law in a PAS-held state. While Najib enjoys the support of senior Umno officials, such as Home Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and Defence Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein, some are more circumspect. Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin has called on Najib to give a convincing explanation or denial of the money transfer allegations, while saying the investigation should be allowed to run its course. Tun Musa Hitam, deputy prime minister from 1981 to 1986 under Mahathir, has called on Najib to step aside temporarily. Some opposition figures say Najib’s support may fade as the investigations roll on. “Najib is comfortably ensconced in Umno for now,” said Lim Kit Siang, a lawmaker and leader of the Democratic Action Party. Still, “there are people who are quietly questioning what he has allegedly done and how this economy is being handled. It is too ambitious to say that he will be around until the next general elections.” — Bloomberg", "labels": [[0, 3, "ORG"], [16, 22, "DATE"], [28, 42, "MONEY"], [118, 126, "GPE"], [144, 155, "PERSON"], [168, 173, "PERSON"], [223, 230, "ORG"], [235, 244, "GPE"], [246, 253, "DATE"], [256, 264, "GPE"], [280, 304, "PERSON"], [455, 474, "ORG"], [487, 501, "MONEY"], [715, 720, "ORG"], [807, 827, "PERSON"], [833, 838, "PERSON"], [888, 929, "ORG"], [973, 981, "GPE"], [988, 992, "DATE"], [1002, 1009, "ORG"], [1200, 1218, "PERSON"], [1268, 1272, "DATE"], [1389, 1398, "NORP"], [1411, 1429, "DATE"], [1646, 1650, "DATE"], [1710, 1715, "ORDINAL"], [1724, 1728, "DATE"], [1732, 1741, "NORP"], [1928, 1946, "PERSON"], [1951, 1955, "ORG"], [1974, 1986, "GPE"], [2028, 2032, "ORG"], [2091, 2106, "PERSON"], [2122, 2140, "FAC"], [2145, 2161, "ORG"], [2168, 2172, "PERSON"], [2204, 2209, "ORG"], [2369, 2376, "ORG"], [2386, 2392, "DATE"], [2398, 2412, "MONEY"], [2510, 2515, "GPE"], [2528, 2533, "PERSON"], [2594, 2605, "ORG"], [2638, 2643, "PERSON"], [2648, 2654, "DATE"], [2687, 2697, "DATE"], [2805, 2810, "GPE"], [2843, 2848, "GPE"], [2886, 2894, "PERSON"], [2967, 2980, "PERSON"], [2997, 3001, "ORG"], [3022, 3033, "PERSON"], [3046, 3054, "GPE"], [3099, 3106, "ORG"], [3154, 3159, "PERSON"], [3165, 3175, "NORP"], [3181, 3188, "DATE"], [3551, 3558, "DATE"], [3589, 3600, "MONEY"], [3606, 3617, "MONEY"], [3621, 3628, "DATE"], [3651, 3662, "MONEY"], [3666, 3688, "DATE"], [3708, 3715, "ORG"], [3728, 3753, "PERSON"], [3770, 3774, "DATE"], [3804, 3814, "CARDINAL"], [3840, 3844, "DATE"], [3875, 3879, "DATE"], [3903, 3907, "PERSON"], [3961, 3969, "PERSON"], [4027, 4032, "PERSON"], [4063, 4071, "PERSON"], [4078, 4083, "PERSON"], [4123, 4128, "NORP"], [4142, 4155, "PERSON"], [4182, 4215, "ORG"], [4232, 4241, "NORP"], [4257, 4261, "DATE"], [4388, 4397, "DATE"], [4401, 4410, "DATE"], [4427, 4441, "CARDINAL"], [4479, 4489, "CARDINAL"], [4587, 4597, "CARDINAL"], [4673, 4681, "GPE"], [4877, 4886, "PERSON"], [4902, 4951, "ORG"], [4955, 4964, "GPE"], [4969, 4976, "ORG"], [5002, 5006, "DATE"], [5201, 5227, "ORG"], [5268, 5284, "LAW"], [5360, 5364, "DATE"], [5402, 5413, "CARDINAL"], [5490, 5504, "ORG"], [5561, 5575, "ORG"], [5593, 5602, "DATE"], [5614, 5668, "ORG"], [5818, 5823, "PERSON"], [5908, 5921, "PERSON"], [5940, 5945, "PERSON"], [6018, 6023, "NORP"], [6103, 6114, "CARDINAL"], [6124, 6126, "CARDINAL"], [6127, 6137, "NORP"], [6157, 6164, "ORG"], [6188, 6207, "PERSON"], [6229, 6244, "DATE"], [6279, 6285, "DATE"], [6331, 6342, "GPE"], [6364, 6369, "DATE"], [6427, 6437, "NORP"], [6451, 6468, "MONEY"], [6501, 6532, "ORG"], [6543, 6566, "PERSON"], [6568, 6574, "DATE"], [6597, 6600, "CARDINAL"], [6613, 6616, "MONEY"], [6623, 6626, "CARDINAL"], [6636, 6641, "PERSON"], [6655, 6659, "DATE"], [6685, 6711, "PERSON"], [6745, 6769, "PERSON"], [6777, 6790, "ORG"], [6803, 6812, "GPE"], [6814, 6826, "DATE"], [6839, 6846, "NORP"], [6859, 6863, "PERSON"], [6900, 6907, "NORP"], [6971, 6974, "ORG"], [7005, 7008, "ORG"], [7027, 7032, "PERSON"], [7062, 7066, "PRODUCT"], [7086, 7090, "ORG"], [7100, 7110, "PERSON"], [7111, 7129, "PERSON"], [7151, 7182, "PERSON"], [7233, 7257, "PERSON"], [7272, 7277, "GPE"], [7424, 7438, "PERSON"], [7467, 7471, "DATE"], [7475, 7479, "DATE"], [7486, 7494, "PERSON"], [7510, 7515, "PRODUCT"], [7571, 7578, "ORG"], [7628, 7633, "PERSON"], [7662, 7666, "PERSON"], [7682, 7695, "PERSON"], [7722, 7749, "ORG"], [7953, 7966, "PERSON"]]}
{"text": "A labourer stands next to a reactor at a pyrolysis unit in Jokhabad industrial area in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India May 9, 2019. — Reuters pic PASIR GUDANG, May 31 — When local investigators scoured a riverbed in southern Malaysia for clues in a chemical dumping case that hospitalised over one thousand people earlier this year, they found a cocktail of toxins, including a colourless liquid commonly secreted when tyres are recycled. That led environment officials and police to a small firm called P. Tech Resources involved in pyrolysis — a business of burning old tyres to make low-grade oil that industry sources say is also common elsewhere in South-east Asia, China and India. Police have charged a lorry driver and all three of P. Tech’s directors for violating a law prohibiting the illegal dumping of waste. The firm’s directors and the firm also each face 15 charges for offences related to waste controls and air pollution brought by the environment department. They have all denied wrongdoing. Lawyers representing them and local police declined comment citing ongoing court proceedings. Reuters was not able to reach the three directors of P. Tech or the company secretary, the only four company officials listed in documents filed with Malaysia’s companies regulator. Its premises were closed and calls to its registered office went unanswered. The documents show P. Tech, registered in 2017, manufactures and trades tyre oils. Done properly, in a controlled environment, tyre pyrolysis has been lauded by the recycling industry as a green way of turning a complex waste into a useful energy source. In this process, tyres are heated in the absence of oxygen and the gases released are condensed into a low-quality oil that can be used in asphalt or fuel oil, depending on its purity. Some firms in Europe and the United States have developed technology to limit emissions and waste from pyrolysis, but with low margins this green approach has not had widespread commercial success, industry experts said. Reuters visited the premises of P. Tech. Piles of tyres bound in bales, a tall chimney and a filthy pond could be seen behind closed gates. Neighbouring workers told Reuters the firm operated at night and its work produced a stench that would linger until the morning. No one from P. Tech was available for comment. “Tyre pyrolysis is not a problem. The problem is with the mismanagement of it,” Yeo Bee Yin, Malaysia’s environment minister told Reuters when asked about the pyrolysis industry in her country. She noted P. Tech was licensed for pyrolysis but did not speak specifically about the dumping case. Yeo said Malaysia used to have “very lax environmental laws” and “very low punishments” for breaches but has stepped up enforcement recently and closed down some illegal pyrolysis operators in order to better regulate the sector. A labourer sprays water around a reactor at a pyrolysis unit in Jokhabad industrial area in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India May 9, 2019. — Reuters pic Backyard operations Malaysia’s department of environment said 22 tyre pyrolysis firms across the country are licensed but declined comment on the number of unlicensed operators. Over half a dozen industry sources said pyrolysis in India, China and South-east Asia also is prevalent mostly in small backyard operations. Earlier this month, Reuters visited a cluster of about 10 tyre burning factories in an industrial area in Jokhabad, a town on the outskirts of India’s capital New Delhi. Mounds of black powder lay on open ground at the first plant, as about half a dozen workers wearing no protection, some barefoot, their clothes and skin stained black, milled about. Most said they lived inside the plant itself, pointing to a cement shed set up barely a few feet away from large, round recycling machines. At a second plant, where a teenager sorted through a pile of odd-sized tyres, plant supervisor Manoj Kumar said he was producing oil mainly used as tar for road construction. While he maintained his plant had high standards, Kumar said most of the other firms in the area were lax, had no mechanism for waste processing and their factories emitted potentially harmful gases in the air. Reuters could not verify his comments. Shops and homes stood barely a kilometre (a half-mile) from the industrial cluster. A report commissioned by Indian environmental rights group SAFE last year said at one site in Jokhabad, carbon fumes and sludge were so bad that monkeys in the surrounding area had black faces and fur. Reuters couldn’t independently confirm its findings. SAFE sent its findings on six plants in a letter to India’s environment ministry in January, and said they were exposing “people at large to environmental risks” and “risking the lives of those involved in such practices for perverse profits.” India’s environment ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the SAFE report. There is no official data on the size of this business, which is being fuelled by a global demand for tyres expected to rise about 3 percent this year to nearly three billion units, according to a report by Cleveland, Ohio-based research firm Freedonia. With free raw material — used tyres — and demand for unconventional oils increasing for everything from tar to build roads to fuel for ships, pyrolysis can be a lucrative business even at a small scale. Asphalt currently sells for about US$100 (RM420) per tonne, while fuel oil sells for about US$400 per tonne. Steel wire recovered after the pyrolysis process of used tyres is seen at a unit in Jokhabad industrial area in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India May 9, 2019. — Reuters pic Lax laws Villager Zulkifly Kassim was one of the first to become aware of the dumping of chemicals by P. Tech in the Sungai Kim Kim river in the Malaysian state of Johor on March 7. Shortly after midnight he was awoken by a putrid smell. He went outside to investigate and shone a torchlight into the stream behind his house. “I could see the water already had become black and the fish were coming up and down,” said Zulkifly, 50. Minutes before Zulkifly was awoken, a lorry parked near a bridge upstream from his house and dumped oil waste and sludge into the river, according to the chargesheet filed in court by the police against P. Tech. Over the next few hours and days after the dumping, noxious vapours caused breathing problems, vomiting and dizziness, especially among children and elderly, local authorities said. Selahudeen Aziz, Johor state’s health director, said over 1,200 people were hospitalised with 26 treated in intensive care. Fourteen people were brought to hospital unconscious. The ports around southern Malaysia where the March dumping took place and nearby Singapore make up the world’s most important marine refuelling hub. Two oil traders in Singapore, requesting anonymity, told Reuters that oil from Malaysian tyre pyrolysis had been offered around the market in recent months in the marine oil sector, known as bunker fuel. They said blending such oil into bunker fuels was on the rise as tightening regulations due to come in next year have pushed up benchmark bunker fuel prices to their highest seasonal level in years. — Reuters", "labels": [[59, 67, "GPE"], [109, 122, "GPE"], [124, 129, "GPE"], [130, 141, "DATE"], [143, 169, "ORG"], [171, 177, "DATE"], [236, 244, "GPE"], [300, 317, "CARDINAL"], [325, 342, "DATE"], [515, 532, "ORG"], [665, 670, "LOC"], [676, 680, "LOC"], [682, 687, "GPE"], [692, 697, "GPE"], [742, 747, "CARDINAL"], [751, 760, "ORG"], [882, 884, "CARDINAL"], [1116, 1123, "ORG"], [1150, 1155, "CARDINAL"], [1169, 1176, "ORG"], [1207, 1216, "CARDINAL"], [1266, 1274, "GPE"], [1394, 1401, "PERSON"], [1417, 1421, "DATE"], [1829, 1835, "LOC"], [1840, 1857, "GPE"], [2068, 2075, "GPE"], [2202, 2209, "ORG"], [2231, 2236, "TIME"], [2292, 2303, "TIME"], [2317, 2324, "ORG"], [2353, 2357, "PERSON"], [2445, 2453, "GPE"], [2482, 2489, "ORG"], [2556, 2563, "PERSON"], [2655, 2663, "GPE"], [2940, 2948, "GPE"], [2990, 3003, "GPE"], [3005, 3010, "GPE"], [3011, 3022, "DATE"], [3058, 3066, "GPE"], [3100, 3102, "CARDINAL"], [3216, 3233, "CARDINAL"], [3269, 3274, "GPE"], [3276, 3281, "GPE"], [3286, 3291, "GPE"], [3297, 3301, "LOC"], [3357, 3375, "DATE"], [3377, 3384, "ORG"], [3406, 3414, "CARDINAL"], [3463, 3471, "GPE"], [3500, 3505, "GPE"], [3516, 3525, "GPE"], [3576, 3581, "ORDINAL"], [3592, 3610, "CARDINAL"], [3788, 3805, "QUANTITY"], [3854, 3860, "ORDINAL"], [3944, 3955, "PERSON"], [4074, 4079, "PERSON"], [4235, 4242, "ORG"], [4318, 4327, "QUANTITY"], [4383, 4389, "NORP"], [4417, 4421, "ORG"], [4422, 4431, "DATE"], [4440, 4443, "CARDINAL"], [4452, 4460, "GPE"], [4639, 4642, "CARDINAL"], [4665, 4670, "GPE"], [4697, 4704, "DATE"], [4857, 4862, "GPE"], [4934, 4938, "ORG"], [5072, 5087, "PERCENT"], [5088, 5097, "DATE"], [5101, 5121, "CARDINAL"], [5154, 5163, "GPE"], [5165, 5169, "GPE"], [5190, 5199, "GPE"], [5404, 5411, "ORG"], [5432, 5444, "MONEY"], [5489, 5501, "MONEY"], [5597, 5605, "GPE"], [5647, 5660, "GPE"], [5662, 5667, "GPE"], [5668, 5679, "DATE"], [5695, 5698, "PERSON"], [5713, 5728, "PERSON"], [5744, 5749, "ORDINAL"], [5797, 5804, "PERSON"], [5819, 5826, "PERSON"], [5840, 5849, "NORP"], [5859, 5864, "GPE"], [5868, 5875, "DATE"], [5891, 5899, "TIME"], [5976, 5986, "TIME"], [6113, 6121, "PERSON"], [6123, 6125, "DATE"], [6127, 6134, "TIME"], [6142, 6150, "GPE"], [6330, 6337, "ORG"], [6344, 6362, "TIME"], [6521, 6536, "PERSON"], [6538, 6543, "PERSON"], [6579, 6584, "CARDINAL"], [6615, 6617, "CARDINAL"], [6645, 6653, "CARDINAL"], [6725, 6733, "GPE"], [6744, 6749, "DATE"], [6780, 6789, "GPE"], [6848, 6851, "CARDINAL"], [6867, 6876, "GPE"], [6905, 6912, "ORG"], [6927, 6936, "NORP"], [6990, 7003, "DATE"], [7155, 7164, "DATE"], [7244, 7249, "DATE"]]}
{"text": "THE wheels of justice never stop turning. Throughout history, they have evolved to take into account the changing circumstances of society, the value systems, the opening up of new knowledge frontiers and also technological innovations. But justice in the legal system is a constant, in that it is premised on the firm belief that all men are entitled to equal protection before the law. The administration of justice must be fair and transparent. And, for all civilised societies, justice must always be tempered with mercy. It is in this context that we should examine the statement made by Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Seri Nazri Aziz about the Government looking into the possibility of abolishing the mandatory death sentence for drug offences. One of the reasons, he said, is that it is difficult to appeal to other countries not to hang Malaysians when our country has the same penalty for the same offences. Close to 250 Malaysians have been arrested as drug mules and sentenced to death abroad, including in China, Venezuela and Peru. But the issue of the death penalty goes beyond that. More than two-thirds of the countries in the world have abolished the death penalty in law or in practice. Of the 58 nations that still have the death penalty in their statutes, only 18 are known to carry out executions. Sadly, Malaysia is among those countries where the death penalty is mandatory for crimes such as murder, possession of firearms, waging war against the King and drug trafficking. Various people, from politicians and lawyers to anti-death penalty advocates, have regularly voiced their views on this issue. So, too, the common folk whose views for and against the death penalty are often determined by some controversial case at that time. Even retired judges have weighed in on the debate and spoken about their personal anguish and difficulty in passing the death sentence. One retired Court of Appeal judge said: “The law is the law but I wish Parliament would abolish the death sentence because if a mistake is made, it would be irreversible. There are other ways of dealing with heinous crimes.” The ball is actually in the court of our august house. It is time our MPs engage in a full debate on the death penalty. If need be, a select committee can be set up to seek the views of as many people as possible. We must have an intelligent discourse on this issue so that we can separate emotions from the facts. It is normal, when emotions run high, for some people to even call for the death penalty to be imposed on snatch thieves, baby dumpers and other lesser criminals. And in any debate on the death penalty, it would also be timely to look into the other parallel issue of mandatory sentences. Again, when the ruling of a particular court case does not resonate with the court of public opinion, there will always be calls to make it mandatory for judges to mete out specific punishment. A mandatory sentence ties the hand of the presiding judge to weigh every offence on its merits, taking into account the circumstances of the case. It does not allow a judge to exhibit compassion even when justice cries out for it. Let us be clear that the death penalty is irreversible, and any miscarriage of justice comes at the very heavy price of a life lost needlessly. And research has also shown that the death penalty has not been an effective deterrent against the crimes it is supposed to minimise. It is time to abolish it.", "labels": [[669, 679, "ORG"], [771, 774, "CARDINAL"], [865, 875, "NORP"], [937, 949, "CARDINAL"], [950, 960, "NORP"], [1038, 1043, "GPE"], [1045, 1054, "GPE"], [1059, 1063, "GPE"], [1118, 1138, "CARDINAL"], [1232, 1234, "CARDINAL"], [1296, 1303, "CARDINAL"], [1346, 1354, "GPE"], [1914, 1917, "CARDINAL"], [1926, 1941, "ORG"], [1985, 1995, "ORG"]]}
{"text": "Lead counsel R. Sivarasa (second left) poses with A. Kugan's mother N. Indra and family members outside the courtroom in Putrajaya December 9, 2013. — Picture by Melissa Chi PUTRAJAYA, Dec 9 – The Court of Appeal today postponed the government’s challenge against the wrongful death suit won by the family of A. Kugan, who died in police detention, to February 28 owing to public interest. Datuk Mohamad Ariff Yusoff, one of three presiding judges, said the court would allow at least one whole day to hear submissions from both sides. “Since it’s a matter of public interest, I’ll give you one to two days, just in case, take your time,” he told the lawyers. On July 1, Home Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi announced the government’s intention to appeal even as Malaysians bay for blood over reports on the alarming number of deaths in police custody — cases similar to Kugan’s controversial death in 2009. In the ruling over the negligence suit brought by Kugan’s family, the High Court on June 26 awarded his mother, N. Indra, RM851,700 in damages for assault and battery, false imprisonment, misfeasance of public office, pain and suffering. Kugan, then 22 years old, was detained as a luxury car theft suspect. He was arrested in Puchong on January 14, 2009 and held overnight at the Puchong Jaya police lock-up before police obtained a remand order. He was taken to the Taipan USJ, Subang Jaya police station two days later for questioning and was found dead four days after that. Former police constable V. Navindran was the only one held responsible for Kugan’s death. Last year, he was convicted and sentenced to three years’ jail. He is currently appealing the conviction. Today, the family’s lead counsel, Sivarasa Rasiah, said the government’s appeal should be dismissed because High Court judge Datuk V.T. Singham gave a “very comprehensive and thorough judgment” analysing all the issues. “We will come here to defend the judgment as a correct judgment, on facts and that the correct award was handed out. “Our position is quite straightforward. Yes, Navindran was part of the group of people who had assaulted but he was not the only one, they were making him a scapegoat to try to whitewash (the case), the judge correctly found that was exactly what was going on that Navindran was used as a scapegoat in a cover up,” he told reporters outside the courtroom. Meanwhile, senior defence counsel Mohd Azizan Mat Ashraf said that the government’s appeal is based on the contention that Sections 7 and 8 of the Civil Law Act 1956 only provide for compensation for estate and exemplary claims. “On our legal point of view, Kugan is not entitled because the law doesn’t allow it because the main issue is that they brought this matter under Section 7 and 8 of the Civil Law Act. “The court has gone about importing these claims which are under the common law claims,” he said, adding that the ruling will be a precedent in Malaysia,” he said. Mohd Azizan said the government is appealing the RM300,000 in exemplary damages, RM50,000 for misfeasance in public office and RM100,000 for false imprisonment. Lawyer Ramesh Sivakumar, who is appealing on behalf of Navindran, said the law does not include damages for misfeasance in public office, which was included in the damages awarded to the claimants. “First time it has come out and the High Court allowed it, whether they are going to affirm it or overturn it, we’ll see. What the judge has done is that he has given ... over and above what is under the law,” he said.

{"text": "Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim told CNN he believed MH370’s Captain Zaharie Ahmad was opposed to extremism and fanaticism. — Picture by Choo Choy May KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 — Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the Malaysia Airlines (MAS) pilot now in the centre of investigations on missing Flight MH370, was opposed to extremism and fanaticism, according to Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. Anwar, who has admitted to knowing the 53-year-old pilot to some degree, told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in an interview aired this morning that Zaharie had merely been an ardent supporter of the federal opposition’s cause, which he stressed was about “democratic reform”. “Certainly he is not,” Anwar said when asked if he believed Zaharie to be a fanatic. “He supports our multi-racial coalition. He supports democratic reform. He is against any form of extremism,” he said in the interview, which was aired at 3am this morning. “And we take a very strong position in clamouring for change through constitutional and democratic means.” As hours turned into days and days into nearly two weeks now, answers to why and how the Boeing 777 wide-body aircraft had gone missing the morning of March 8 have grown even more scant. Investigators have been relying on what could best be described as piecemeal evidence gathered from data weaned off the defence systems of several nations. What the authorities finally agreed on — one week after MH370’s disappearance — is that the plane, which had been bound for Beijing from Malaysia’s capital city here, had veered suddenly westwards in mid-flight. The changed flight path had been deliberate, according to Malaysian officials on Saturday. The revelation sent investigators back to the drawing board as they refocused their probe on the backgrounds of those on board flight MH370 — all 227 passengers and 12 crew members. And suddenly Zaharie, the veteran MAS pilot who had earlier been described as “passionate” about flying, became a key concern. Local police searched the homes of Zaharie and that of his co-pilot Fariq Ab Hamid last Saturday, taking away the former’s home-built flight simulator for inspection. Today, local and foreign experts, including those from the US’s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are poring over data installed in the simulator and trying to retrieve whatever information the pilot had deleted. But this could take days or even weeks, CNN reported this morning. Anwar, whose link to the pilot suddenly surfaced amid media scrutiny on the latter’s background, confirmed to reporters yesterday that the man was related to his daughter-in-law. He was asked again to speak on the link by Amanpour and the leader said his daughter-in-law called the MAS pilot “uncle”. Amanpour, quoting from Anwar’s press secretary, had asked the Pakatan Rakyat (PR) de facto chief to confirm if Zaharie was indeed his “son’s wife’s mother’s father’s brother’s son”. “What my daughter-in-law told me is that he is a family member, not too close, but she calls him ‘uncle,’ which is quite common here. But I know him... basically as a party activist,” Anwar replied. He appeared as well to dismiss links between Zaharie and his sodomy II case, in which he had been sentenced to five years in jail just hours before MH370 went missing. Anwar said that based on what he gathered from the pilot’s colleagues, Zaharie had indeed been “disturbed” by the court’s decision. But he was quick to add that “many others were disturbed”. “I mean, we were shocked and appalled by the speed of the process of the court of appeal.” “But I think that’s quite normal. I don’t think it’s something that would trigger a person of his expertise, calibre, to do any unwanted activity. I am absolutely certain of that,” Anwar said, according to CNN’s report.", "labels": [[0, 24, "PERSON"], [30, 33, "ORG"], [46, 53, "ORG"], [62, 75, "PERSON"], [130, 139, "PERSON"], [158, 166, "DATE"], [177, 195, "PERSON"], [197, 218, "ORG"], [278, 290, "PRODUCT"], [346, 370, "PERSON"], [372, 377, "PERSON"], [450, 453, "ORG"], [456, 475, "PERSON"], [498, 510, "TIME"], [516, 523, "PERSON"], [667, 672, "PERSON"], [704, 711, "PERSON"], [884, 900, "TIME"], [1030, 1034, "DATE"], [1039, 1043, "DATE"], [1049, 1065, "DATE"], [1098, 1104, "ORG"], [1105, 1108, "PRODUCT"], [1145, 1167, "TIME"], [1393, 1401, "DATE"], [1408, 1415, "ORG"], [1476, 1483, "GPE"], [1489, 1497, "GPE"], [1622, 1631, "NORP"], [1645, 1653, "DATE"], [1789, 1796, "ORG"], [1801, 1804, "CARDINAL"], [1820, 1822, "CARDINAL"], [1850, 1857, "PERSON"], [1999, 2006, "PERSON"], [2032, 2046, "PERSON"], [2047, 2060, "DATE"], [2131, 2136, "DATE"], [2186, 2226, "ORG"], [2228, 2231, "ORG"], [2368, 2372, "DATE"], [2381, 2386, "DATE"], [2388, 2391, "ORG"], [2401, 2413, "TIME"], [2415, 2420, "PERSON"], [2497, 2499, "PERSON"], [2535, 2544, "DATE"], [2637, 2645, "PERSON"], [2697, 2700, "ORG"], [2716, 2724, "PERSON"], [2739, 2746, "ORG"], [2774, 2792, "FAC"], [2827, 2834, "PERSON"], [3082, 3087, "PERSON"], [3142, 3149, "PERSON"], [3165, 3167, "PERSON"], [3208, 3218, "DATE"], [3227, 3237, "TIME"], [3245, 3250, "NORP"], [3265, 3270, "PERSON"], [3336, 3343, "PERSON"], [3384, 3386, "ORG"], [3728, 3733, "PERSON"], [3753, 3756, "ORG"]]}
{"text": "Khalid conceded today that he is facing pressure from leaders within his own party to step down but added he was already ‘used to the pressure’. — Picture by Choo Choy May SHAH ALAM, July 16 — Tan Sri Khalid Ibrahim today rebuffed renewed speculation that he will be made to step down as Selangor mentri besar, reiterating that he will stay on until the end of his term. Conceding that he is facing pressure from leaders within his own PKR party to step down, Khalid stressed that he will not do so and that he was already “used to the pressure”. “I think I have stated that I am going to serve until the end of my term, I have to keep my promise to the people of Selangor when I took my oath as mentri besar,” Khalid told reporters at a news conference here. “I took my oath to manage the state until the next election,” the Port Klang assemblyman asserted. The Malay Mail Online understands that while some key PAS leaders like Shah Alam MP Khalid Samad want a change in MB, both PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang and PAS secretary-general Datuk Mustafa Ali are in full support of the current Selangor MB and have made that clear last week during a private meeting. It is also understood that PR has yet to decide on who should be the next Selangor MB. While some within the pact want PKR president Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail to take over, several leaders in PKR’s Selangor chapter still prefer her deputy Azmin Ali, who is now making a renewed bid for the post by lobbying among DAP and PAS. It is understood that Hadi had given Khalid a “personal guarantee” that PAS would support him to stay as MB until the end of his term even if DAP or PKR decided otherwise. But according to an anonymous source quoted in news reports in Astro Awani and The Star yesterday, the decision to appoint Azmin as the next MB is awaiting the endorsement of Opposition Leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. The source had said that Azmin is believed to have been chosen over PKR president Wan Azizah as PAS reportedly has issues with her gender. But Azmin himself later rubbished reports of him winning DAP and PAS’s support to replace Khalid as Selangor mentri besar, saying he was not even present at a closed-door tripartite meeting where the decision was supposedly made. The PKR deputy president said yesterday that not only was he not at the meeting purportedly held on Monday night, he was not even in the country. “I have no idea. I am in Medina (Saudi Arabia). Already left KL yesterday (Monday),” Azmin told The Malay Mail Online via text message yesterday. Khalid’s position as mentri besar has remained contentious since his own party, PKR, initiated the so-called “Kajang Move” to oust him from the position in March. The move was ostensibly engineered to remove Khalid and to replace him with PKR’s de facto leader Anwar, who had intended to contest the Kajang state seat which was vacated in February. But the “Kajang move” fell through after the appellate court overturned his sodomy acquittal and sentenced him to five years in jail, days before the by-election’s nomination. Anwar has filed for an appeal against this decision. Although Anwar’s disqualification had then appeared to put to rest plans to remove Khalid, recent controversies involving the Selangor administration have prompted new agitations for his removal. Among others, these include the still-unresolved row over the seizure of bibles in the state and Khalid’s perceived partiality towards the developers of the proposed Kinrara-Damansara Expressway that is facing mounting resistance from state residents. A major barrier to Khalid’s removal was the absence of a clear candidate to replace him, with Azizah previously being touted as the most likely candidate.", "labels": [[0, 6, "ORG"], [16, 21, "DATE"], [158, 167, "PERSON"], [183, 207, "DATE"], [216, 221, "DATE"], [288, 296, "PERSON"], [436, 439, "ORG"], [460, 466, "ORG"], [664, 672, "PERSON"], [711, 717, "PERSON"], [826, 836, "GPE"], [863, 880, "ORG"], [913, 916, "ORG"], [930, 939, "PERSON"], [943, 955, "PERSON"], [973, 975, "GPE"], [982, 985, "ORG"], [996, 1023, "PERSON"], [1028, 1031, "ORG"], [1050, 1067, "PERSON"], [1103, 1114, "PERSON"], [1140, 1149, "DATE"], [1250, 1261, "PERSON"], [1295, 1298, "ORG"], [1309, 1319, "PERSON"], [1327, 1344, "PERSON"], [1378, 1392, "ORG"], [1425, 1434, "PERSON"], [1507, 1510, "ORG"], [1534, 1538, "PERSON"], [1549, 1555, "PERSON"], [1584, 1587, "ORG"], [1617, 1619, "ORG"], [1654, 1657, "ORG"], [1661, 1664, "ORG"], [1747, 1758, "PERSON"], [1763, 1771, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1772, 1781, "DATE"], [1807, 1812, "PERSON"], [1825, 1827, "ORG"], [1859, 1869, "ORG"], [1877, 1901, "PERSON"], [1928, 1933, "PERSON"], [1971, 1974, "ORG"], [1985, 1995, "PERSON"], [1999, 2002, "ORG"], [2046, 2051, "PERSON"], [2099, 2102, "ORG"], [2107, 2112, "ORG"], [2132, 2138, "PERSON"], [2142, 2150, "PERSON"], [2276, 2279, "ORG"], [2302, 2311, "DATE"], [2372, 2384, "TIME"], [2443, 2449, "GPE"], [2451, 2463, "GPE"], [2479, 2481, "GPE"], [2482, 2491, "DATE"], [2493, 2499, "DATE"], [2503, 2508, "PERSON"], [2553, 2562, "DATE"], [2564, 2570, "ORG"], [2644, 2647, "ORG"], [2674, 2685, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2720, 2725, "DATE"], [2772, 2778, "ORG"], [2803, 2806, "ORG"], [2825, 2830, "PERSON"], [2864, 2870, "GPE"], [2903, 2911, "DATE"], [2922, 2928, "PERSON"], [3027, 3037, "DATE"], [3047, 3051, "DATE"], [3074, 3076, "PRODUCT"], [3089, 3094, "PERSON"], [3151, 3156, "PERSON"], [3225, 3231, "ORG"], [3268, 3276, "PERSON"], [3435, 3443, "ORG"], [3504, 3521, "ORG"], [3609, 3617, "ORG"], [3684, 3690, "NORP"]]}
{"text": "Tan Sri Khalid Ibrahim has suggested that he is not prepared to yield his position as Selangor mentri besar to Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail without a fight. — Picture by Choo Choy May KUALA LUMPUR, July 22 ― Tan Sri Khalid Ibrahim today highlighted potential roadblocks to PKR’s plan to remove him as Selangor mentri besar, suggesting he is not prepared to yield the position to Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail without a fight. In a strongly-worded statement, Khalid warned that any attempt to replace him must be done according to the state’s laws, which specify several processes or provisions before a new state mentri besar can assume office. “I respect the decision of PKR’s political bureau which has nominated PKR president Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail as the new mentri besar. “However, I hold strongly to the state enactment which has set specific guidelines for the appointment or replacement of the mentri besar,” he said in a statement sent to The Malay Mail Online. Khalid added that those involved in “efforts” to unseat him will need to first fulfil these processes or criteria before they can achieve their “desired objectives”. He urged Selangor residents to not be “easily influenced” by provocative and controversial news on his possible removal, and that this issue has not affected the state’s administration or business investments. “Until the process is complete and done, I will carry on as mentri besar with full responsibility, dedication and dignity as bestowed upon me by the people of Selangor who chose me through a legitimate selection process,” the Port Klang assemblyman stressed. A source close to the Selangor MB told The Malay Mail Online that PAS would not likely support Khalid’s removal when Pakatan Rakyat (PR) convenes its presidential council meeting tomorrow. “There is a strong indication that when this goes to the presidential council, PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang will reject it,” the source said. Another possible issue is whether the Selangor Sultan will agree or give his consent as state Ruler to Khalid’s removal as MB. “The Sultan’s view and consent on the matter is crucial as the MB, whoever is the MB, needs to be able to maintain good ties with the palace,” the source added. PKR confirmed yesterday it nominated Dr Wan Azizah to replace Khalid, who has been at loggerheads with party leaders over his running of the country’s richest state. Although PKR may have decided on removing Khalid, the question remains whether PR allies PAS and DAP will accept Dr Wan Azizah’s nomination. It is understood that while DAP is agreeable to replacing Khalid with the PKR president, top PAS leaders are not keen on the move and want him to remain as state mentri besar. Khalid’s position as mentri besar has remained contentious since his own party, PKR, initiated the so-called “Kajang Move” to oust him from the position in March.

{"text": "Khairy said Umno Youth was committed to fighting not only for issues affecting the Malays but also other races so that it was seen as more inclusive. — Picture by Yusof Mat Isa KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 27 — Umno Youth would continue stressing on issues related to the cost of living affecting the younger generation at the Umno General Assembly 2014 next month, said its leader Khairy Jamaluddin. Besides its main agenda of fighting for the lot of young Malays, the wing would also try to touch on issues affecting the younger generation from the other races too. The focus of Umno Youth in the coming general assembly is still on issues of the younger generation, (and) I will have a briefing with the speakers from our delegation to touch on issues of the rising cost of living, education, affordable homes, the economy and current political issues, he said after chairing the Umno Youth Exco meeting at Menara Dato Onn, here, today. Khairy, who is also Youth and Sports Minister, said Umno Youth was committed to fighting not only for issues affecting the Malays but also other races so that it was seen as more inclusive. At the same time, Khairy said, the wing would organise two simultaneous events on Nov 16 - the townhall meeting and the housing congress - which would focus on the contents of 2015 presented by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak recently. Our focus is to give information to the young professionals on the initiatives and incentives under the Budget, which affect them, and we want to get feedback from the younger generation on government policies which can still be improved. At the housing congress, we will table a resolution on the need of housing for the younger generation, to add to the announcement made by the PM in the Budget, he said. Khairy also expressed his appreciation to Minister of Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government Datuk Abdul Rahman Dahalan for accepting Umno Youth's idea to create transit homes for married youths. He said Umno Youth was committed to helping the ministry identify suitable landed locations to build new transit homes, besides ensuring that the youths who fulfilled the conditions, had access to the facility, regardless of race and religion. Meanwhile, on the talk by Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim: 40 Years from Universiti Malaya (UM) To Prison tonight, Khairy said it was not something that university students should defend as it was personal politics. He said although students' rights to freedom of speech should be respected, it should not be manipulated by certain parties to gain sympathy since the appeal of the opposition leader's sodomy case would be heard tomorrow. We support programmes for knowledge, in fact I myself have attended debates and forums in campuses, to watch opposition party personalities. It is not a problem. But when they organise programmes with one sole aim, which is to instigate students and to send a lop-sided political message, without giving a chance for other parties to reply, then I do not think it is a suitable event, he added. Khairy was commenting on the talk programme which was said to be Anwar's effort to gain sympathy from outside parties as a last-ditch attempt to ensure his political continuity, especially with the outcome of his appeal in the Federal Court tomorrow.

{"text": "Anwar holds up the hand of UM student council president Fahmi Zainol as they enter University Malaya, October 27, 2014. — Pic by Choo Choy May KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 28 — DAP’s Lim Kit Siang poured scorn on Universiti Malaya’s dubious lockdown yesterday in what many see as a “silly” bid to bar controversial alumnus Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim from entering its campus here. The DAP parliamentary leader compared the efforts Malaysia’s oldest university took in shutting all its gates and power to the Dewan Tunku Canselor — the venue for Anwar’s scheduled talk — to a hypothetical situation in which the world-famous Oxford University would bar British Opposition Leader Edward Miliband from returning to his alma mater. “[Imagine] the lockdown of the University of Oxford and the shutdown of all electricity supplies to plunge one of the leading universities in the world into darkness just to deny the British Opposition Leader, Edward Miliband from returning to his alma mater campus to address the undergraduates?” the DAP advisor asked rhetorically in a statement. The Gelang Patah MP also compared yesterday’s incident where all of UM’s gates were closed to another hypothetical scenario of a lockdown of Australia’s Monash University to bar the country’s Opposition Leader William Shorten from speaking there. But Lim then went on to say that such “silly notions” should be dismissed, that it would be “completely unthinkable” for any administrator of universities in the UK or US to lock down their campuses simply to stop opposition politicians from addressing students at their alma mater universities. “Lockdown/shutdown of University of Malaya to prevent Anwar from speaking to students is latest example of “first world infrastructure, third world mentality” afflicting our universities which will condemn the nation to a future of mediocrity,” he said. Lim said the lockdown and alleged power shutdown at UM represented a “stain and stigma” to the country’s premier university’s reputation, urging Education Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin to launch a full inquiry to find out who was responsible for the move and take disciplinary action against them. Yesterday, a circular from UM registrar Yusoff Musa instructed staff and students to leave by 4pm, as power would be interrupted in the evening for repairs and maintenance to a damaged substation located on its premises. UM student union (PMUM) immediately sent the notice to the media yesterday, alleging that the interruption was meant to sabotage the “40 Years: From University of Malaya to Jail” talk that the university’s authorities have categorised as illegal. When contacted earlier today, UM’s media unit chief Izzad Zalman Abdul Kader rejected any attempts to link Anwar’s talk to the purported scheduled power interruption at the university yesterday. “There was no power cut at all,” he told Malay Mail Online today, saying that the event and the email informing staff of a planned early closure of the university were “not related”. “It’s a normal case,” Izzad said, saying that the university would allow its staff to leave early when deemed “appropriate” or “necessary”, adding that the last time they were allowed to do so was during Deepavali. Last night, students gathered outside the locked gates of UM and pushed their way through after waiting for more than two hours. Anwar, a UM alumnus, then managed to enter campus grounds and address a massive crowd of students — with estimates ranging from hundreds to 2,000 — on the eve of the Federal Court’s appeal hearing over his second sodomy conviction and sentence. In his high profile and first sodomy case in 1998, the former deputy prime minister was sentenced to jail for nine years in 2000 but was acquitted by the Federal Court four years later. Today, Izzad confirmed that UM’s security director Yusof Harun has lodged a police report over the trespass of private property for an event that was not approved and alleged property damage. He also said that UM has launched an internal probe on all UM students who were involved in the talk featuring Anwar.", "labels": [[0, 5, "PERSON"], [27, 29, "ORG"], [56, 68, "PERSON"], [83, 100, "PERSON"], [102, 118, "DATE"], [129, 138, "PERSON"], [172, 185, "PERSON"], [202, 221, "ORG"], [239, 248, "DATE"], [312, 336, "PERSON"], [372, 375, "ORG"], [418, 426, "GPE"], [495, 500, "NORP"], [532, 539, "ORG"], [611, 628, "ORG"], [639, 646, "NORP"], [665, 680, "PERSON"], [742, 766, "ORG"], [894, 916, "ORG"], [925, 940, "PERSON"], [1017, 1020, "ORG"], [1064, 1083, "ORG"], [1098, 1107, "DATE"], [1205, 1214, "GPE"], [1217, 1234, "ORG"], [1274, 1289, "PERSON"], [1315, 1318, "PERSON"], [1473, 1475, "GPE"], [1479, 1481, "GPE"], [1629, 1649, "ORG"], [1661, 1666, "PERSON"], [1743, 1748, "ORDINAL"], [1861, 1864, "PERSON"], [1913, 1915, "ORG"], [2006, 2015, "ORG"], [2025, 2049, "PERSON"], [2163, 2172, "DATE"], [2190, 2192, "ORG"], [2203, 2214, "PERSON"], [2257, 2260, "QUANTITY"], [2449, 2458, "DATE"], [2533, 2553, "ORG"], [2646, 2659, "TIME"], [2661, 2665, "ORG"], [2683, 2695, "PERSON"], [2696, 2707, "PERSON"], [2738, 2743, "PERSON"], [2815, 2824, "DATE"], [2867, 2884, "ORG"], [2885, 2890, "DATE"], [3031, 3036, "ORG"], [3213, 3222, "PERSON"], [3224, 3234, "TIME"], [3332, 3351, "TIME"], [3353, 3358, "PERSON"], [3362, 3364, "ORG"], [3481, 3498, "CARDINAL"], [3515, 3534, "ORG"], [3559, 3565, "ORDINAL"], [3622, 3627, "ORDINAL"], [3643, 3647, "DATE"], [3708, 3718, "DATE"], [3722, 3726, "DATE"], [3748, 3765, "ORG"], [3766, 3782, "DATE"], [3784, 3789, "DATE"], [3791, 3796, "ORG"], [3835, 3846, "PERSON"], [3994, 3996, "ORG"], [4035, 4037, "ORG"], [4087, 4092, "PERSON"]]}
{"text": "The couple’s relationship started to deteriorate about three years before the fatal stabbing on September 4 last year because the hairstylist wanted to be ‘publicly recognised’ as the deceased’s partner, but the latter wanted to keep their relationship low-profile and hid it from his parents. — TODAY pic SINGAPORE, Sept 26 — A 40-year-old hairstylist was sentenced to 12 years’ jail today for stabbing his 48-year-old lover to death after the latter wanted to end the relationship. The court heard that Tan Chee Yeow and the deceased Tan Chin Siong, who was an assistant vice president at UOB, were in a same-sex romantic relationship after they met each other in Johor Baru in 2007. Both are Malaysians. Their relationship started to deteriorate about three years before the fatal stabbing on September 4 last year because Tan wanted to be “publicly recognised” as the deceased’s partner, but the latter wanted to keep their relationship low-profile and hid it from his parents. Tan also consumed alcohol habitually and threatened to commit suicide on several occasions, the court heard. The prosecution said their relationship took a turn for the worse on the deceased’s birthday on August 28 last year, after Tan started complaining that the deceased had failed to keep his promise to introduce him as his partner to the deceased’s family as well as to help Tan sell his piece of land in Kuching, in East Malaysia. The following day, the deceased had plans to return to JB to celebrate his birthday with his family members. But before he reached JB, Tan had called the deceased’s mother to inform her of their relationship. The deceased’s mother was shocked and told the accused that “it was not possible for them”. Later that day, the deceased ignored Tan’s calls and messages. On August 30, the deceased called Tan and told him that he was not gay, and that he wanted to get married and have children. The pair also visited a psychiatrist on August 31, who said that Tan’s initial diagnosis of depression with generalised anxiety disorder and alcohol dependence had been further aggravated by domestic issues between them. During the visit, the psychiatrist had advised the deceased to delay the intended breakup by two weeks while Tan started on his medication to “stabilise his emotions”. But later on, the deceased called the psychiatrist again as he wanted end the relationship immediately. On September 4, Tan headed to the deceased’s residence and brought along a knife — which he bought the day before to commit suicide — as he intended to use it to kill the deceased before killing himself if the latter refused to reconcile with him. While making his way there, he spotted the deceased walking in the opposite direction towards Ang Mo Kio MRT station. Tan approached the deceased and pleaded with him not to end their relationship. He also told the deceased even if he wanted to end their relationship, he should “do it slowly and not so suddenly as he (Tan) could not take it”. Tan also repeatedly asked the deceased to accompany him the following day, but the deceased said he needed to keep his family company. Sensing that there was little chance of them reconciling, Tan decided to kill the deceased before killing himself. He took out the knife and stabbed the deceased twice on the chest and once on the back before a passer-by stopped him. In sentencing, Judicial Commissioner Audrey Lim said Tan had deliberately brought a knife along with him and had the intention to kill the deceased. He knew what he was going to do and made a conscious decision to take a person’s life, added the judge. — TODAY", "labels": [[10, 12, "ORG"], [49, 66, "DATE"], [96, 117, "DATE"], [192, 194, "ORG"], [306, 315, "ORG"], [322, 324, "CARDINAL"], [370, 378, "DATE"], [385, 390, "DATE"], [505, 518, "PERSON"], [536, 550, "PERSON"], [591, 594, "ORG"], [666, 676, "PERSON"], [680, 684, "DATE"], [695, 705, "NORP"], [749, 766, "DATE"], [796, 817, "DATE"], [826, 829, "PERSON"], [982, 985, "PERSON"], [1172, 1174, "ORG"], [1187, 1206, "DATE"], [1214, 1217, "PERSON"], [1334, 1336, "PERSON"], [1363, 1366, "PERSON"], [1393, 1400, "GPE"], [1405, 1418, "LOC"], [1551, 1553, "PERSON"], [1555, 1558, "PERSON"], [1582, 1584, "ORG"], [1641, 1643, "ORG"], [1758, 1761, "PERSON"], [1787, 1796, "DATE"], [1818, 1821, "PRODUCT"], [1949, 1958, "DATE"], [1974, 1979, "ORG"], [2223, 2232, "DATE"], [2239, 2242, "PERSON"], [2405, 2416, "DATE"], [2418, 2421, "PERSON"], [2501, 2508, "DATE"], [2744, 2754, "PERSON"], [2768, 2771, "PERSON"], [2970, 2973, "PERSON"], [2995, 2998, "PERSON"], [3188, 3191, "PERSON"], [3401, 3411, "PERSON"], [3417, 3420, "PERSON"]]}
{"text": "Nurul Izzah Anwar said she has initiated legal action against the New Straits Times and Berita Harian over their reports of an alleged written confession by a former PSI executive. — File pic KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 8 — PKR’s Nurul Izzah Anwar said today that she has initiated legal action against Umno-linked papers the New Straits Times (NST) and sister publication Berita Harian over their reports quoting former PetroSaudi International (PSI) executive Xavier Andre Justo as saying that the PKR lawmaker had offered to buy stolen 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) data from him. The English-language and Malay-language dailies respectively, which are published by The New Straits Times Press (NSTP) owned by the Media Prima media group, reported Justo as saying in a written confession that he had rejected Nurul Izzah’s alleged offer to buy the information on the state investment firm for US$2 million, in the form of future government contracts should Barisan Nasional (BN) lose power, as he had wanted cash. “For the record, I categorically deny that I have ever offered US$2 million to Justo in future government contracts when the opposition came into power. I have never met him before,” Nurul Izzah said in a statement. “The NST and Berita Harian have front-paged this complete lie in a sensationalised manner, and without any regard as to whether there is any truth in the allegations. I have accordingly instructed my solicitors to commence legal proceedings against the NST and Berita Harian,” the Lembah Pantai MP and PKR vice-president added. NST also reported today Justo as saying that Clare Rewcastle-Brown, editor of London-based whistleblower site Sarawak Report, had acted as the intermediary between him and Nurul Izzah. Justo pled guilty last month in Thailand to a charge of attempting to blackmail Saudi-based PSI over purportedly incriminating documents and was sentenced to three years’ jail. Nurul Izzah stressed today that the issue was not about Justo’s theft of documents, but what the documents, together with reports by US-based paper the Wall Street Journal, Sarawak Report, and local business paper The Edge, said about corruption allegations surrounding 1MDB. “Question 1: 1MDB borrowed RM42 billion...using sovereign guarantees of the Malaysian government. What have they got to show for it? “Question 2: How did more than US$1 billion belonging to the PetroSaudi-1MDB joint venture end up in Jho Low’s companies’ accounts? “Question 3: The RM2.6 billion (US$700 million), which was deposited in the prime minister’s personal account. Was it really from the so-called donor from the Middle East or was it the 1MDB billions returning full circle?” she said. Nurul Izzah said such questions could be answered by Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s bank accounts and the 1MDB money trail and that this was why PKR had filed for the discovery of documents in its suit against the prime minister over allegations of financial misappropriation involving 1MDB. Among others, the suit seeks access to Najib’s monthly bank statements from 2009, receipt of RM2.6 billion from Tanore Finance Corp into his personal accounts, receipt of RM42 million from SRC International Sdn Bhd into his personal accounts, documents, minutes, correspondence, records and agreements on SRC’s RM4 billion loan from Retirement Fund Incorporated, as well as all monthly bank statements for 1MDB and its subsidiaries accounts both in and out of the country. The Wall Street Journal reported last July that almost US$700 million was moved around companies linked to 1MDB before it ended up in Najib’s personal bank accounts in March 2013, two months before the 13th general election. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission has, however, said that the money did not come from 1MDB, but from Middle Eastern donors that it did not identify.", "labels": [[0, 17, "PERSON"], [62, 83, "ORG"], [88, 94, "GPE"], [166, 169, "ORG"], [211, 212, "CARDINAL"], [227, 238, "PERSON"], [244, 249, "DATE"], [313, 334, "ORG"], [336, 339, "ORG"], [364, 370, "GPE"], [412, 436, "ORG"], [438, 441, "ORG"], [453, 465, "PERSON"], [466, 471, "PERSON"], [491, 494, "ORG"], [540, 558, "WORK_OF_ART"], [585, 592, "LANGUAGE"], [606, 611, "LANGUAGE"], [666, 693, "ORG"], [695, 699, "ORG"], [714, 725, "ORG"], [748, 753, "PERSON"], [809, 822, "PERSON"], [893, 905, "MONEY"], [957, 977, "ORG"], [1077, 1089, "MONEY"], [1093, 1098, "GPE"], [1235, 1238, "ORG"], [1243, 1256, "PRODUCT"], [1483, 1486, "ORG"], [1491, 1504, "PERSON"], [1532, 1535, "ORG"], [1558, 1561, "ORG"], [1576, 1581, "DATE"], [1582, 1587, "PERSON"], [1603, 1624, "ORG"], [1636, 1642, "GPE"], [1668, 1682, "PERSON"], [1730, 1741, "PERSON"], [1743, 1748, "PERSON"], [1761, 1771, "DATE"], [1775, 1783, "GPE"], [1823, 1828, "NORP"], [1835, 1838, "ORG"], [1901, 1912, "DATE"], [1920, 1931, "PERSON"], [1941, 1946, "DATE"], [1976, 1983, "ORG"], [2053, 2055, "GPE"], [2068, 2091, "ORG"], [2093, 2107, "PERSON"], [2138, 2142, "ORG"], [2206, 2207, "CARDINAL"], [2272, 2281, "NORP"], [2339, 2340, "CARDINAL"], [2350, 2372, "MONEY"], [2430, 2439, "ORG"], [2471, 2472, "CARDINAL"], [2474, 2491, "MONEY"], [2493, 2507, "MONEY"], [2616, 2631, "LOC"], [2694, 2705, "PERSON"], [2747, 2771, "PERSON"], [2833, 2836, "ORG"], [3019, 3026, "ORG"], [3027, 3034, "DATE"], [3056, 3060, "DATE"], [3092, 3111, "ORG"], [3169, 3194, "ORG"], [3234, 3241, "TIME"], [3285, 3288, "ORG"], [3313, 3341, "ORG"], [3358, 3365, "DATE"], [3453, 3476, "ORG"], [3486, 3495, "DATE"], [3501, 3522, "MONEY"], [3587, 3592, "GPE"], [3621, 3631, "DATE"], [3633, 3659, "DATE"], [3678, 3718, "ORG"], [3786, 3800, "LOC"]]}
{"text": "File photo of ex-policemen Azilah Hadri and Sirul Azhar Umar (heads covered) at the Court of Appeal in Putrajaya on August 23, 2013. — File pic KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 11 — News network Al Jazeera has published a sensational investigation into the 2006 murder of Mongolian Altantuya Shaariibuu that alludes to “massive cover-ups” by senior Malaysian officials, at a time when Putrajaya is under pressure over a separate corruption controversy. The episode of Al Jazeera’s “101 East” series largely revisits already established details of the murder and does not appear to include new information of note, but features dramatic re-enactments of key moments of the case including the murder to the Mongolian by two former police commandos. Despite reproducing existing information, the programme does introduce a new alleged killer in the convoluted murder saga: Razak Baginda, Altantuya’s former lover and ex-aide to Datuk Seri Najib Razak when the latter was still deputy prime minister. Hosted by Mary Ann Jolley, the allegations of attempts by Putrajaya to cover up investigations into the case appear to be predicated on her deportation while in the midst of preparing the particular episode. “It obviously shows the sensitivity of the story, and I’ve obviously come under the spotlight,” Jolley said in a self-recorded clip for the segment, after she was stopped from entering Malaysia following a meeting with Setev Shaariibuu, Altantuya’s father, in Hong Kong for the programme. “Clearly, I’ve hit a raw nerve,” Jolley added as she was deported to Sydney, Australia. Other parts of the programme include interviews with key personalities of the case who were supportive of claims that there was a cover-up, including Setev and his lawyer, Ramkarpal Singh, as well as Americk Sidhu who had represented the late P. Balasubramiam or “PI Bala”. Balasubramaniam had made two controversial statutory declarations in 2008 that formed the basis of links between Najib and the Altantutya case. Also featured in the episode titled “Murder in Malaysia” were old video clips from the trial as well as other interviews with individuals who were not directly involved. Late in the clip, Jolley interviews a purported Australian “relative” of Sirul Azhar Umar, one of two police commandos convicted of Altantuya’s murder. Christened as “Frank” by Jolley, the person goes on to claim that Sirul told him that Razak was the person who shot and killed Altantuya in 2006. Razak declined to be interviewed, but rubbished Sirul’s claims as recounted by “Frank”. The Prime Minister’s Office similarly declined Jolley’s request for interviews for her episode, but reiterated Najib’s previous denials of any acquaintance with Altantuya. “The prime minister did not know, has never met, has never had any communication with and has no link whatsoever with the deceased. “The two convicted individuals were not the prime minister's personal guards. This allegation is intentionally misleading, and has been used to perpetuate baseless conspiracy theories,” it said in a statement to Al Jazeera. Sirul and Azilah Hadri, another former police commando, were both sentenced to death in January this year for the 2006 murder after the Federal Court reversed their previous acquittal. Sirul was a no-show during the sentencing, however, and it was later revealed that he had fled to Australia to live with his kin. He is currently being detained by Australian Immigration pursuant to Malaysia’s request for extradition, which Australia cannot legally comply with owing to the country’s laws against capital punishment. The Altantuya scandal was among the reasons former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad gave earlier this year to explain his demand for Najib’s resignation as prime minister, although he has now shifted his focus to 1Malaysia Development Bhd as his main platform to press for Najib’s exit.", "labels": [[27, 39, "PERSON"], [44, 60, "PERSON"], [80, 99, "ORG"], [103, 112, "GPE"], [116, 131, "DATE"], [163, 165, "CARDINAL"], [181, 191, "ORG"], [243, 247, "DATE"], [258, 288, "ORG"], [335, 344, "NORP"], [371, 380, "ORG"], [454, 466, "ORG"], [468, 471, "CARDINAL"], [691, 700, "NORP"], [704, 707, "CARDINAL"], [856, 869, "PERSON"], [871, 882, "ORG"], [911, 933, "FAC"], [993, 1008, "PERSON"], [1041, 1050, "ORG"], [1287, 1293, "PERSON"], [1376, 1384, "GPE"], [1410, 1426, "PERSON"], [1428, 1439, "ORG"], [1451, 1460, "GPE"], [1513, 1519, "PERSON"], [1549, 1555, "GPE"], [1557, 1566, "GPE"], [1718, 1723, "PERSON"], [1740, 1755, "PERSON"], [1768, 1781, "ORG"], [1811, 1827, "PERSON"], [1831, 1839, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1842, 1857, "PERSON"], [1867, 1870, "CARDINAL"], [1911, 1915, "DATE"], [1955, 1960, "ORG"], [1969, 1979, "PERSON"], [2033, 2041, "GPE"], [2204, 2214, "NORP"], [2229, 2245, "PERSON"], [2247, 2250, "CARDINAL"], [2254, 2257, "CARDINAL"], [2288, 2299, "ORG"], [2323, 2328, "PERSON"], [2333, 2339, "PERSON"], [2374, 2379, "PERSON"], [2394, 2399, "PERSON"], [2448, 2452, "DATE"], [2502, 2509, "ORG"], [2534, 2539, "PERSON"], [2589, 2597, "ORG"], [2653, 2660, "ORG"], [2703, 2712, "NORP"], [2851, 2854, "CARDINAL"], [3058, 3068, "ORG"], [3080, 3092, "PERSON"], [3158, 3175, "DATE"], [3184, 3188, "DATE"], [3202, 3219, "ORG"], [3353, 3362, "GPE"], [3419, 3441, "ORG"], [3454, 3462, "GPE"], [3496, 3505, "GPE"], [3593, 3602, "NORP"], [3655, 3661, "PERSON"], [3662, 3678, "PERSON"], [3684, 3701, "DATE"], [3728, 3733, "ORG"], [3818, 3833, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3868, 3875, "ORG"]]}

He was previously scheduled to be hanged on Friday morning. But this was put off following a last minute appeal that was filed last night and heard and subsequently dismissed the next morning. His family members are said to be on their way to prison, TODAY understands. After a failed appeal by lawyer Gino Singh yesterday morning, lawyer Jeannette Chong-Aruldoss requested a stay of execution on the basis that she had just filed a civil application for Kho. This was dismissed and she immediately filed an appeal, which was heard today. Before the Court of Appeal this morning, Chong-Aruldoss, together with fellow lawyer Alfred Dodwell whom she had roped in, sought an adjournment claiming they were ill-prepared for the appeal. Rejecting this, Judge of Appeal Chao Hick Tin said: “Any attempt to stop the legal process must be on sufficient legal grounds.” Dodwell later argued that the test used by the court to determine the imposition of a death sentence was too vague, and the re-sentencing regime had been unconstitutional, subjecting Kho to unequal treatment. State Counsel Francis Ng countered that the civil application and appeal was an abuse of process, meant to “buy more time”. Justice Chao, delivering the judgment on behalf of the five judges, said that the arguments raised had been discussed in earlier hearings, and this was merely an attempt to re-argue matters. “This will throw the whole system of justice into disrepute,” said Justice Chao. “This case has been about many things, but today it is about the abuse of the process of the court.” Yesterday’s eleventh-hour stay of execution is the second for the 31-year-old Sarawakian who had bludgeoned a Chinese construction worker to death in 2008. In November last year, he secured a stay of execution less than 48 hours before he was due to hang by mounting an appeal, which failed. Kho was sentenced to the mandatory death penalty after he killed Chinese construction worker Cao Ruyin during a robbery near Geylang Drive by bashing the victim on the head with a tree branch that caused 14 skull fractures. His roller-coaster court bid began in 2011 with a failed challenge against the murder conviction, only to be spared the hangman’s noose two years later when amendments to the mandatory death penalty regime kicked in that gave judges the discretion to sentence certain types of murderers to life imprisonment instead. But his reprieve was scrubbed, on appeal by prosecutors. Last year, he failed to commute the sentence with an argument that there was new and compelling evidence to prove a miscarriage of justice. In today’s first hearing, he took issue with the fact that Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang had been involved in two stages of his case, which his lawyer Gino Hardial Singh claimed was “a breach of natural justice”. Then, Justice Chao had said that this was a rehash of a point he had raised previously. He said: “We said that there comes a point, after the appeals have been heard and the applications for reviews have been decided, when the legal process must recede into the background and give way to the search for repose. We think the time has come.” — TODAY", "labels": [[21, 31, "PERSON"], [47, 60, "PERSON"], [86, 98, "TIME"], [157, 163, "DATE"], [185, 195, "PERSON"], [218, 223, "DATE"], [237, 266, "ORG"], [275, 286, "DATE"], [316, 325, "NORP"], [358, 371, "TIME"], [417, 423, "DATE"], [424, 431, "TIME"], [466, 477, "TIME"], [500, 510, "TIME"], [548, 564, "TIME"], [624, 629, "ORG"], [675, 685, "PERSON"], [686, 695, "DATE"], [696, 703, "TIME"], [712, 736, "PERSON"], [828, 831, "PERSON"], [905, 910, "DATE"], [919, 938, "ORG"], [953, 967, "PERSON"], [997, 1011, "PERSON"], [1137, 1150, "PERSON"], [1234, 1241, "ORG"], [1417, 1420, "PERSON"], [1443, 1448, "ORG"], [1457, 1467, "PERSON"], [1575, 1579, "PERSON"], [1622, 1626, "CARDINAL"], [1833, 1837, "PERSON"], [1940, 1965, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1991, 1997, "ORDINAL"], [2018, 2028, "NORP"], [2050, 2057, "NORP"], [2090, 2094, "DATE"], [2099, 2117, "DATE"], [2150, 2168, "TIME"], [2232, 2235, "PERSON"], [2297, 2304, "NORP"], [2325, 2334, "ORG"], [2357, 2370, "FAC"], [2436, 2438, "CARDINAL"], [2494, 2498, "DATE"], [2583, 2585, "ORG"], [2592, 2607, "DATE"], [2830, 2839, "DATE"], [2973, 2978, "DATE"], [2981, 2986, "ORDINAL"], [3045, 3057, "PERSON"], [3079, 3082, "CARDINAL"], [3120, 3138, "PERSON"], [3196, 3200, "PERSON"]]}
{"text": "Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi speaks during the Bagan Datoh Umno delegates meeting at Wisma Umno, Hutan Melintang in Bagan Datoh, Aug 6, 2016. — Bernama pic BAGAN DATOH, Aug 6 — All parties be they political leaders or the public have been reminded not to belittle Malaysia’s sharing of information on security with other countries. Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi stressed that such sharing of information was important in light of terrorist threats which could materialise anytime. “The question is not ‘if’ but ‘when it’s going to happen’, don’t think this is a political issue, don’t think we (authorities) are just trying to intimidate. “We give information so that we can be alert and take action, we don’t want an attack such as at the entertainment centre in Puchong, Selangor on July 28,” he told reporters after the Bagan Datoh Umno delegates meeting at Wisma Umno, Hutan Melintang here today. The meeting attended by 477 delegates was officiated by Umno vice president Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein, who is also Defence Minister. Ahmad Zahid who is also Home Minister said the cooperation of political parties was crucial in the government’s concerted effort to prevent activities by militants such as IS, from snaking among the population. “We should handle the IS threat together, set aside political interest and together overcome the influence of IS through social media,” he said. Asked on the six Indonesians who were arrested in Pulau Batam for planning an attack on Singapore, Ahmad Zahid said there were currently more than 300 followers of Abu Bakar Bashir on the island. “He was sentenced to three years in prison and is now free, that’s why they are in Batam, they want to make it a new IS territory,” he said. The deputy prime minister said the authorities had placed various security assets and strength in high risk areas to ensure that such terrorist threat and influence would not enter Malaysia. “We have identified ‘black spots’ (hotbeds where cells exist) . Apart from that we will also be using the Regional Digital Counter-Messaging Communication Centre to monitor social media,” he said. In the media conference, Ahmad Zahid slammed Perak DAP chairman Ng Kor Ming who wanted to launch a campaign to collect 10,000 signatures to prevent the Kamunting Detention Centre in Taiping from being turned into a IS detention centre. “The Prisons Department has refurbished the detention centre to enable the process of deradicalisation on the inmates to be conducted so that they could be accepted again by the people. “We do not have the time and money to build a new centre, so we are using the Kamunting Camp. There is no compromise with the country’s security, even though it is different, it should be well received,” he said. The Deputy Prime Minister also assured residents in Taiping and its surrounding areas not to be worried about their security over the decision of the government. Meanwhile, Hishammuddin agreed with Ahmad Zahid that political leaders have important roles to help curb the threats of IS. “The need is not only confronting our country, even major countries are also facing problems in combating IS. So use the Umno delegates’ meeting as the platform to raise the awareness among the respective members,” he said. Earlier, in his speech Hishammuddin said IS was not only a threat to security but also a threat to the country’s democracy and sovereignty. “Now, Malaysia which is an Islamic country is being threatened by IS whose ideology, approach and actions are completely wrong in Islam. “Umno should also be the defender of Islam, by becoming a movement against evil elements trying to damage Islam and its good image,” he said. — Bernama", "labels": [[22, 32, "PERSON"], [36, 54, "PERSON"], [73, 89, "ORG"], [111, 121, "PERSON"], [123, 138, "GPE"], [142, 153, "GPE"], [159, 166, "DATE"], [199, 200, "CARDINAL"], [290, 298, "GPE"], [380, 390, "PERSON"], [394, 412, "PERSON"], [815, 822, "GPE"], [824, 832, "PERSON"], [836, 843, "DATE"], [874, 890, "ORG"], [912, 922, "GPE"], [924, 939, "PERSON"], [945, 950, "DATE"], [976, 979, "CARDINAL"], [1008, 1012, "ORG"], [1028, 1059, "PERSON"], [1073, 1080, "ORG"], [1091, 1102, "PERSON"], [1460, 1463, "CARDINAL"], [1464, 1475, "NORP"], [1497, 1508, "GPE"], [1535, 1544, "GPE"], [1546, 1557, "PERSON"], [1584, 1597, "CARDINAL"], [1611, 1627, "PERSON"], [1664, 1675, "DATE"], [1726, 1731, "GPE"], [1965, 1973, "GPE"], [2197, 2208, "PERSON"], [2217, 2226, "GPE"], [2236, 2247, "PERSON"], [2291, 2297, "CARDINAL"], [2320, 2350, "ORG"], [2354, 2361, "GPE"], [2409, 2431, "ORG"], [2859, 2866, "GPE"], [2980, 2992, "PERSON"], [3005, 3016, "PERSON"], [3214, 3218, "PERSON"], [3340, 3352, "PERSON"], [3463, 3471, "GPE"], [3484, 3491, "NORP"], [3587, 3592, "ORG"], [3631, 3636, "ORG"], [3700, 3705, "ORG"]]}
{"text": "Shaariibuu Setev arrives at the Shah Alam Hight Court January 25, 2019. ― Picture by Yusof Mat Isa SHAH ALAM, Jan 25 — The father to slain Mongolian model Altantuya Shaariibuu told the High Court today that his daughter had travelled to Malaysia in October 2006 to meet an individual identified as “Razak”. Testifying as the second witness in his family’s RM100 million civil lawsuit against the Malaysian government, Altantuya’s convicted killers and the man she had an affair with, Shaariibuu Setev said his daughter met him at their home between October 7 and 8, 2006 prior to her departure to Kuala Lumpur. Shaariibuu, 69, who is a retired professor from the Mongolian National University, however said he did not know how ‘Razak’ looked like at that time. “All that she told me was Razak. I do not know which Razak, Abdul Razak Baginda or Najib Razak,” he said through Mongolian interpreter Enkhjin Batbilig under questioning from his lawyer Ramkarpal Singh. Abdul Razak was a political analyst and had headed a think tank called the Malaysian Strategic Research Centre based in Kuala Lumpur previously. He was also an adviser to Datuk Seri Najib Razak when the latter was defence minister (2000 to 2008) and deputy prime minister (between January 2004 and April 2009) before taking over as prime minister from April 3, 2009 to May last year. Najib has repeatedly denied knowing Altantuya or that he had any part in her death. Shaariibuu said Altantuya, fondly known as “Amina”, had gone to the toilet midway during their conversation, leaving her luggage with him when her phone rang. “I opened her bag and I saw a photo of two men with her. I asked her specifically who they were because my daughter was in it. “To which she answered these are the people she was going to meet in Malaysia,” he testified. Shaariibuu said he was aware of his daughter’s frequent visit to Malaysia and had asked Altantuya if she had any reason to visit Malaysia so often during their meeting at his home in Mongolia in October 2006. “She told me she was in a relationship with a ‘big’ man whose name was Baginda and that the trip was important because she wanted to arrange medical help for her handicapped son who was born with cerebral palsy,” he said. He said he also later discovered among Altantuya’s possession a flight ticket purchased by a ‘Razak’ dated March 23, 2005 and jewellery receipt from Habib worth RM11,300 that was dated March 4, 2005. “I also discovered a letter from Abdul Razak Baginda dated March 2, 2006 addressed to Altantuya for US$18,000. “It was not signed by him but was signed by Altantuya in acknowledgement of the said funds,” he said. Also present were Abdul Razak’s lawyer Kuan Chee Foo and senior federal counsel Norinna Bahadun for the government. The hearing resumes Monday morning with the testimonial hearing of Shaariibuu. Altantuya’s parents Shaariibuu and Altantsetseg Sanjaa, and Altantuya’s two sons had on June 4, 2007 filed the civil lawsuit to claim compensation for the mental shock and psychological trauma they suffered over her death. However, Altantuya’s younger son, 15-year-old Alatanshagai Munkhtukga, was removed as plaintiff when he died in 2017. In the lawsuit where Altantuya’s family is seeking RM100 million as compensation, Sirul Azhar Umar, Azilah Hadri, Abdul Razak and the government of Malaysia were named as defendants. Sirul and Azilah were convicted by the High Court in 2009 of killing Altantuya. They succeeded in overturning their conviction at the Court of Appeal in 2013, but the Federal Court in 2015 restored their conviction and sentenced them to death. Abdul Razak who was accused of abetting the two former police officers in her murder was acquitted. Sirul fled to Australia after the death sentence and is currently under detention there as Australian laws do not allow extradition of anyone to a country where they will be killed.

{"text": "Altantuya Shaariibuu’s son, Mungunshagi Bayarjargal (right), is pictured at Shah Alam High Court January 30, 2019. — Picture by Yusof Mat Isa SHAH ALAM, Jan 30 — The son of the slain Mongolian model Altantuya Shaariibuu told the High Court here today that their family went through a lot of difficulties and had a challenging life after her death. Testifying as the fourth witness in the family’s RM100 million suit against the Malaysian government, Mungunshagai Bayarjargal, who was nine at the time, said he had a tough time coping with his mother’s passing. “It was very hurtful when people around me were always talking about her murder in Malaysia, especially in Ulaanbaatar, where the community is small and everyone knows each other. It was totally unbearable for me as a young child. “For the first three years or so, I had to spend my three summer vacations living with relatives in the countryside just to escape the gossip over my mother’s murder in Malaysia. “It was a very lonely, painful and sad time growing up as I remember clearly listening to my friends’ parents telling their children not to play with me just because my mother was murdered in Malaysia,” he said. Mungunshagai said he had to change his name to Bayarkhuu Bayarjargal later in life to escape the negative stigma surrounding his mother’s death. “In 2011 or 2012, I changed my name. l had to change my name due to the negative attention that I received after my mother’s death. “After her death and as a result of all the negative publicity from that, I was often bullied and teased in school. After years of enduring this, my grandfather and I discussed it and we decided it would be best for me to change my name,” he said, referring to Shariibuu Setev. Mungunshagai also revealed that he was forced to break up with his girlfriend of three years after her family discovered that he was Altantuya’s son. Despite it all, Mungunshagai remembered Altantuya as a loving mother who cared for him and his younger brother, Altanshagai Munkhtulga. “She was very loving and adventurous. She would always take us out and play with us when she’s around. My fondest memories are of the times that we spent together. “She often took us out to the movies, for picnics and to playgrounds. This is something that my grandparents cannot do for us due to their age, health and financial situation,” he said. Last Monday, Shariibuu testified in court that the family had fallen apart without Altantuya and that the responsibilities to care for her youngest child, Altanshagai who suffered cerebral palsy fell on him and his wife.

{"text": "Catholics attend morning mass at the Church of St Anne in Port Klang, Selangor, January 5, 2013. — Picture by Choo Choy May KOTA KINABALU, March 14 — As reviews for the Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63) begin, the Sabah council of churches (SCC) wants the review committee to also focus on the guarantee of complete religious freedom for Malaysians. This, among others, includes the right to change one’s faith. In a statement issued today by SCC president Bishop James Wong, he welcomed the Prime Minister’s decision to look into the rights of Sabah and Sarawak within the federation but also wanted to remind the committee that religious freedom was one of the fundamental pillars of MA63. “This should be one of the focus for discussion in the current review committee just as it was in the years leading up to the formation of Malaysia as recorded in the Cobbold Commission Report and the Inter-Governmental Committee IGC) Report which led to the finalisation of the MA63 and the Federal Constitution. “The current political leaders must be reminded that without the guarantee of complete religious freedom, there would not have been a Malaysia. This point is well discussed and recorded in our historical documents,” he said. Wong said that some political and community leaders today use Article 3 of the Federal Constitution to declare that Malaysia is an Islamic State. “This is totally in contravention of the Malaysia Agreement 1963. Even the first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj declared before the Legislative Council in 1957 ‘I would like to make it clear that this country is not an Islamic State as it is generally understood. We merely provided that Islam shall be the official religion of the state’,” he said. Wong also quoted an excerpt from the Cobbold Commission Report which said that although Islam should be the national religion for the federation, it would not jeopardise the freedom of religion and Malaysia would be a secular nation. “The reality today is there is no complete religious freedom in Malaysia and religious minorities have been marginalised. Complete religious freedom does not mean only freedom to worship but also freedom to profess and practise the religion of their choice without restrictions and repercussions from the state and without being subject to discrimination, hostility or violence. “Today, many of our people face difficulties in choosing to be identified with the religion of their choice. The National Registration Department (NRD) continues to restrict our people from changing their religious status records,” he said. On the case of a 22-year-old man in Sarawak who was recently sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment and fine for pleading guilty to insulting Islam and the Prophet Muhammad, Wong said that it was too severe a punishment while offensive remarks to other religions did not garner the same response. “While we support efforts to maintain peace, unity and harmony among our diverse society, we condemn the punishment which are to run consecutively on this young first-time offender and regard it as a disproportionate and harsh one. “The controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik who has made slanderous remarks against Christianity instead has been allowed to remain as a permanent resident in our country. Where is fairness and justice in this instance?” he said. He called on the government to moot several steps that would uphold and establish the guarantee of complete religious freedom including a revision of the legislation that would give adequate protection to people of all religions, in particular religious minorities and to ensure everyone can freely exercise their right to freedom of religion and belief, including the right to change one’s religion, without interference by the state. Wong said that the government should also work against any forms of “thought policing” of religious ideas, ban on publications, printings and materials.", "labels": [[0, 9, "NORP"], [10, 24, "TIME"], [33, 54, "FAC"], [58, 68, "GPE"], [70, 78, "PERSON"], [80, 95, "DATE"], [110, 119, "PERSON"], [139, 147, "DATE"], [165, 192, "ORG"], [211, 216, "PERSON"], [238, 241, "ORG"], [335, 345, "NORP"], [396, 399, "CARDINAL"], [431, 436, "DATE"], [440, 443, "ORG"], [454, 471, "PERSON"], [542, 547, "GPE"], [649, 652, "CARDINAL"], [705, 708, "CARDINAL"], [828, 836, "GPE"], [852, 881, "ORG"], [886, 918, "ORG"], [968, 972, "PRODUCT"], [977, 1001, "LAW"], [1137, 1145, "GPE"], [1228, 1232, "PERSON"], [1280, 1285, "DATE"], [1290, 1327, "LAW"], [1344, 1352, "GPE"], [1359, 1366, "NORP"], [1411, 1433, "ORG"], [1434, 1438, "DATE"], [1449, 1454, "ORDINAL"], [1471, 1489, "PERSON"], [1496, 1502, "ORG"], [1519, 1542, "ORG"], [1546, 1550, "DATE"], [1610, 1617, "NORP"], [1679, 1684, "ORG"], [1741, 1745, "PERSON"], [1774, 1803, "ORG"], [1829, 1834, "ORG"], [1939, 1947, "GPE"], [1988, 1993, "DATE"], [2039, 2047, "GPE"], [2355, 2360, "DATE"], [2463, 2499, "ORG"], [2501, 2504, "ORG"], [2631, 2638, "GPE"], [2669, 2677, "DATE"], [2734, 2739, "ORG"], [2744, 2770, "ORG"], [3050, 3055, "ORDINAL"], [3140, 3147, "NORP"], [3157, 3167, "PERSON"], [3208, 3220, "ORG"], [3790, 3794, "PERSON"]]}
{"text": "File photo: RAB detains suspects during an anti-drug drive in Dhaka’s Geneva Camp Mehedi Hasan/Dhaka Tribune The elite force is focusing on border areas to halt the influx of drugs with an aim to destroy all the routes and bases of yaba Law enforcers always attach special priority to the border areas of Chattogram, particularly Cox’s Bazar, because of its strategic location, which is shared with neighbouring Myanmar, the biggest producer of methamphetamine tablets in the world, and the ongoing special drive against illegal drugs is no different. Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), which is leading the ongoing anti-drug drives across Bangladesh, is also putting emphasis on areas such as the Chattogram Hill Tracts and Cox’s Bazar. The elite force is focusing on Cox’s Bazar, Teknaf, and Ukhiya to seal off the entry points of the deadly drug. Some other bordering regions, including Cumilla, Bandarban, Jashore, Feni, and Chapainawabganj are also on the list for special plans. In conversation with the Dhaka Tribune, some high-ups of the elite force said they will try to seal off different routes of yaba trade using their intelligence surveillance. Also Read- War on drugs: 12 more killed in 9 districts Law enforcers said the yaba pills mainly spread through Teknaf in Cox’s Bazar. The consignment first enters Cox’s Bazar then finds way to Chittagong and later spreads across the country. However, the ongoing random raids have forced the drug peddlers to seek alternative routes through mountains and hills. They bring yaba pills first to Khagrachhari and then send them to Feni, Dhaka, and Chattogram by using goods laden trucks. To avoid the law enforcers, drug dealers are going to different places of the country through the sea via Barisal, Barguna, Hatia, and Patuakhali areas. RAB 7 Commanding Officer Miftah Uddin Ahmed said they are conducting drives to nab both big and small fishes. “In addition to increasing surveillance, we are also planning new strategies to bring them to book,” he said, but declined to share any further details of the plan. Apart from the Department of Narcotics Control, RAB, police, Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), Coast Guard, and two intelligence agencies have made a list of drug dealers. The area-based drug traders list has been sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs from the Prime Minister’s Office. Sources said on October 12 last year, a report from the Prime Minister’s Office was given to the Home Ministry. The report made by a special intelligence agency showed horror scenario of drug trade in the northern region. Also Read- Where have Teknaf’s top drug traders gone? Five districts – Rangpur, Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Gaibandha, and Chapainawabganj – have more than 150 drug spots and over 400 people control these spots. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on May 3 called on RAB to come forward to conduct drives against drug abuse the way the force achieved success in anti-militant operations. Between May 4 and 27, RAB has conducted 699 anti-drug operations across the country. As many as 23 alleged drug traders were killed, 723 people detained, drug worth Tk58 crore recovered and 3,147 drug dealers and appraisers were sentenced for different terms by mobile courts. RAB Director General Benazir Ahmed said in different programs that they are conducting all-out drives against drugs, not against particular people. He said the drug dealers and addicts will be arrested, no matter how powerful they are and none will be spared. RAB legal and Media Wing Director Mufti Mahmud Khan said they had declared ‘war against drugs’. Operations in different districts, towns, and suburbs will continue until drug abuse is stamped out. “We also have surveillance in areas where drugs enter. We are working to prevent yaba’s entry into the country,” he said.", "labels": [[62, 67, "GPE"], [89, 100, "ORG"], [237, 240, "PERSON"], [305, 315, "ORG"], [330, 341, "PERSON"], [412, 419, "GPE"], [552, 579, "ORG"], [689, 715, "ORG"], [720, 731, "ORG"], [764, 775, "ORG"], [777, 783, "PERSON"], [789, 795, "ORG"], [885, 892, "PERSON"], [894, 903, "GPE"], [905, 912, "GPE"], [914, 918, "ORG"], [924, 939, "ORG"], [1179, 1181, "CARDINAL"], [1197, 1198, "CARDINAL"], [1209, 1212, "PERSON"], [1265, 1271, "PERSON"], [1304, 1309, "ORDINAL"], [1317, 1328, "ORG"], [1347, 1357, "PERSON"], [1538, 1543, "ORDINAL"], [1547, 1559, "GPE"], [1582, 1586, "PERSON"], [1588, 1593, "PERSON"], [1599, 1609, "ORG"], [1745, 1752, "GPE"], [1754, 1761, "GPE"], [1763, 1768, "GPE"], [1774, 1784, "ORG"], [1798, 1835, "PERSON"], [2078, 2113, "ORG"], [2115, 2118, "ORG"], [2128, 2151, "ORG"], [2153, 2156, "ORG"], [2159, 2170, "ORG"], [2176, 2179, "CARDINAL"], [2286, 2314, "ORG"], [2365, 2385, "DATE"], [2442, 2459, "ORG"], [2593, 2599, "PERSON"], [2625, 2629, "CARDINAL"], [2642, 2649, "GPE"], [2651, 2662, "GPE"], [2664, 2672, "PERSON"], [2674, 2683, "PERSON"], [2689, 2706, "ORG"], [2712, 2725, "CARDINAL"], [2741, 2749, "CARDINAL"], [2793, 2806, "PERSON"], [2810, 2815, "DATE"], [2947, 2967, "DATE"], [2969, 2972, "ORG"], [2987, 2990, "CARDINAL"], [3032, 3045, "CARDINAL"], [3080, 3083, "CARDINAL"], [3112, 3116, "CARDINAL"], [3137, 3142, "CARDINAL"], [3245, 3258, "PERSON"], [3498, 3508, "PERSON"], [3518, 3535, "PERSON"]]}
{"text": "File photo: Law enforcement agencies launched an aggressive anti-narcotics drive across Bangladesh in early May Mehedi Hasan/Dhaka Tribune Drug users are now trying to turn their lives around to stay safe from extrajudicial killings as security forces launched a violent anti-narcotics crackdown all over the country. The operation that started May 4, gained momentum in mid-May, when all units of the police joined Rapid Action Battalion in the drive. Ministers and top government officials continue to assert that they launched the drive to purge the country of the curse of substance abuse and build a narcotics-free nation. The operation has, however, been marred by its controversial modus operandi, widespread allegations of human rights abuses, and alleged favoritism towards drug peddlers associated with the ruling Awami League. Asked, the police headquarters refused to reveal the number of people killed in the crackdown, claiming they do not maintain such records. However, according to media reports and sources at police units across the country, over 153 people, mostly suspected drug dealers, were killed in so-called gunfights in 49 districts since the launch of the drive. Other estimates show that the figure was over 140, as it could not ascertain if some alleged narcotics dealers were killed in firefights among themselves or with security forces. Over 13,000 suspected drug traders were also arrested and around 10,000 cases filed until Wednesday, according to police headquarters sources. RAB said they had arrested 4,114 “drug peddlers” and recovered narcotics worth over Tk67.15 crore. Mobile courts run by the RAB sentenced 3,521 of the arrestees to seven years’ rigorous imprisonment, while the remaining 593 were fined. Sahely Ferdous, assistant inspector general of police (media), said the total amount of drug items recovered in the last one month was worth over Tk70 crore. ‘Drug dealers now disintegrated’ Top police officials said they were conducting drives following “thorough investigations and arresting only listed drug dealers.” The ongoing operation might not help fully destroy narcotics supply chains in Bangladesh but largely disintegrated the rings of notorious drug traders, they claimed. “We could not destroy the supply chain of drugs, but managed to rupture the drug dealers’ network. We are trying to arrest those who are on the run and establish an effective surveillance system so that no new drug barons could emerge,” Sahely said. She added that the drives would help create awareness about drugs, especially among those who have not yet been lured into substance addiction. However, the operation created a huge public outcry after Teknaf municipality councilor Ekramul Haque was killed in a “shootout” with the RAB in Teknaf upazila of Cox’s Bazar on May 26. RAB claimed Ekramul had been involved in drug peddling. Refuting the claim, the deceased’s wife Ayesha Begum alleged that he had been killed in cold blood, not in a gunfight as the anti-crime taskforce claimed. She also gave reporters a total of four audio clips that recorded the terrifying conversations between Ekramul and his wife, and one of their two daughters, just before he died in a hail of bullets. The audio clips, recorded on a mobile phone, also captured sounds of gunfire and the groans of a dying man. Even though the authorities try to establish the fact that such a crackdown was essential to save the nation from negative consequences of drug abuse, the United Nations and human rights defenders condemned the move and voiced their concerns over the increasing deaths in “gunfights”. Issuing a statement June 7, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein said: “I am gravely concerned that such a large number of people have been killed. “We are calling on the [Bangladesh] government to follow through with this commitment and to ensure that this is not just any investigation; it has to be an independent, transparent, meaningful investigation with the view to bringing to justice the perpetrators of these killings.”", "labels": [[88, 98, "GPE"], [102, 111, "DATE"], [345, 350, "DATE"], [371, 378, "DATE"], [416, 438, "ORG"], [824, 836, "ORG"], [1066, 1069, "CARDINAL"], [1147, 1149, "CARDINAL"], [1232, 1240, "CARDINAL"], [1370, 1381, "CARDINAL"], [1428, 1441, "CARDINAL"], [1460, 1469, "DATE"], [1513, 1516, "ORG"], [1540, 1545, "CARDINAL"], [1637, 1640, "ORG"], [1651, 1656, "CARDINAL"], [1677, 1688, "DATE"], [1733, 1736, "CARDINAL"], [1861, 1879, "DATE"], [1895, 1899, "CARDINAL"], [2148, 2158, "GPE"], [2473, 2479, "ORG"], [2688, 2694, "PERSON"], [2718, 2731, "PERSON"], [2768, 2771, "ORG"], [2775, 2781, "GPE"], [2793, 2804, "ORG"], [2808, 2814, "DATE"], [2816, 2819, "ORG"], [2828, 2835, "ORG"], [2904, 2906, "ORG"], [2912, 2924, "PERSON"], [3062, 3066, "CARDINAL"], [3130, 3137, "ORG"], [3156, 3159, "CARDINAL"], [3169, 3172, "CARDINAL"], [3485, 3503, "ORG"], [3639, 3645, "DATE"], [3647, 3649, "ORG"], [3672, 3689, "ORG"], [3696, 3706, "PERSON"]]}
{"text": "Kathua rape case main convict Sanjhi Ram along with other convicts being taken to the District and Sessions Court for the pronouncement of the quantum of punishment in Pathankot, Punjab, Monday, June 10, 2019 (PTI) PATHANKOT: His heart in pieces after the horrific gang rape and murder of his little daughter last year, the man, a nomadic Bakarwal from the higher reaches of Kashmir, had promised he would never return to Kathua. On Monday, moments after a local court in Pathankot sentenced three of the six men involved in the crime to life in prison, the father of the dead girl told TOI from somewhere near Kargil that when he goes to Kathua again, he will sit by his daughter's grave for a long time, in benediction and gratitude.District and sessions judge Tejwinder Singh ordered five years of imprisonment for the remaining three men convicted in the case that shook the country after sordid details of the girl's torture, rape and killing started tumbling out after chilling events of January 10, 2018.The seventh accused, Vishal Jangotra, son of main conspirator Sanji Ram, a retired revenue officer, was acquitted. The eighth accused, who claims to be a juvenile, is yet to face trial as his plea on determination of his age is yet to be heard by the Jammu and Kashmir high court.In the present case, facts are many but the truth is one - that under a criminal conspiracy, an innocent eight-year-old girl has been kidnapped, drugged, raped and ultimately murdered. Perpetrators of the crime have acted in such a manner as if there is a 'law of the jungle' prevalent in society, said the judge in his order.Comparing the victim to a “young chick who wanted to fly high”, judge Singh quoted a Mirza Ghalib couplet: “Pinha tha daam-e-sakht qareeb aashiyaan ke, Udne hi na paaye the ki giraftaar hum hue” (Near the bird’s nest, the young chick was caught in a hard net placed by the hunter before it could take flight).Key accused Sanji Ram, who doubled up as the priest of a local temple where the girl was kept during her torture, his friend Parvesh Kumar and special police officer Deepak Khajuria were held guilty under sections 302 (murder), 376 (rape) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Ranbir Penal Code (RPC) that is in use in J&K. The three men were awarded multiple sentences for various related aspects of the crime, but these would run concurrently with the life sentence. They were also fined Rs 1 lakh each. This means they will be in jail till the end of their lives.Three police personnel — sub-inspector Anand Dutta, special police officer Surender Verma and head constable Tilak Raj — were also held guilty under Section 201 (destruction of evidence) of the RPC. During argument, defence lawyers pleaded for milder punishment for the accused on the grounds that “the entire case was based on circumstantial evidence and wrong facts created by the J&K police”. The prosecution, however, sought death sentence, terming it a “rarest of rare case”. When the quantum of sentence was finally pronounced around 4.50 pm, Jangotra started crying in the courtroom. But Sanji Ram raised slogans, shouting that he is innocent and was framed by police.The Hindu Ekta Manch that had last year taken out processions in Jammu demanding the release of the accused, said the six men were innocent.Back in Kashmir, the father of the girl, said, “Justice has been done though we don’t know how Sanji Ram’s son went free. We miss the sweet soul that we lost. All we can now do is hope for her peace.”In Video: Life imprisonment for 3 convicts in Kathua rape-murder case; 5-year jail term for others", "labels": [[0, 6, "ORG"], [30, 40, "PERSON"], [82, 113, "ORG"], [168, 177, "GPE"], [179, 185, "GPE"], [187, 208, "DATE"], [210, 213, "ORG"], [309, 318, "DATE"], [339, 347, "LOC"], [375, 382, "LOC"], [422, 428, "ORG"], [433, 439, "DATE"], [472, 481, "GPE"], [492, 497, "CARDINAL"], [505, 508, "CARDINAL"], [587, 590, "ORG"], [611, 617, "GPE"], [639, 645, "ORG"], [763, 778, "PERSON"], [787, 797, "DATE"], [832, 837, "CARDINAL"], [994, 1014, "DATE"], [1015, 1022, "ORDINAL"], [1032, 1047, "PERSON"], [1073, 1082, "PERSON"], [1130, 1136, "ORDINAL"], [1262, 1267, "GPE"], [1272, 1279, "LOC"], [1398, 1412, "DATE"], [1691, 1696, "PERSON"], [1706, 1718, "ORG"], [1729, 1734, "PERSON"], [1773, 1777, "PERSON"], [1942, 1951, "PERSON"], [2055, 2068, "PERSON"], [2096, 2111, "PERSON"], [2144, 2147, "CARDINAL"], [2158, 2161, "CARDINAL"], [2173, 2177, "PERSON"], [2203, 2224, "LAW"], [2258, 2263, "CARDINAL"], [2420, 2424, "ORG"], [2496, 2501, "CARDINAL"], [2535, 2546, "PERSON"], [2571, 2585, "LOC"], [2605, 2614, "PERSON"], [2645, 2656, "LAW"], [3045, 3053, "ORG"], [3091, 3100, "PERSON"], [3171, 3191, "ORG"], [3201, 3210, "DATE"], [3236, 3241, "GPE"], [3289, 3292, "CARDINAL"], [3319, 3326, "LOC"], [3359, 3366, "ORG"], [3406, 3417, "PERSON"], [3543, 3544, "CARDINAL"], [3557, 3563, "GPE"]]}
{"text": "Rosli traces his suit against Attorney-General Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail and 10 others to where it all started in 2007. — Picture by Saw Siow Feng KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 20 — Where does one find the courage to sue the Attorney-General, the top government lawyer in the country, for alleged malicious prosecution, prosecutorial misconduct and abuse of power? After successfully clearing his name in the courts, senior lawyer Rosli Dahlan has now filed the suit in hopes of fixing the system, despite having all his faith in it “shattered” and “destroyed” by what he claims was a concerted conspiracy against him by the top prosecutor and the country’s anti-corruption agency. “It has to be done. Someone has to do it, to try to put the system right. Even if we fail, at least we have tried,” Rosli told The Malay Mail Onlinerecently, while admitting to being an idealist who passionately believes in justice, truth and the rule of law. Rosli traces his suit against Attorney-General Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail and 10 others to where it all started in 2007, where he had the most “frightening” and “humiliating” experience of his life at the hands of the government’s anti-graft body then known as the Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA). On Oct 11, 2007, two days before Hari Raya Aidilfitri, ACA officers came to Rosli’s office, asking him to go with them to their headquarters but left after he said he would meet them after the holiday ended. The officers returned later at 2pm, shouting and arresting him in front of his staff, even handcuffing him. “But they didn’t take my statement until it was 8 o’clock at night, six hours later... by then my hands were all bruised and bloodied,” he said, also adding that the ACA did not interview him as a witness before his arrest, despite his attempts to co-operate with them. After his statement was recorded, he was put in a cell until the next day, and was denied the right to see his lawyers and even his wife and children. Rosli said that his watch and mobile phone were also taken away from him. “Immediately at that point I imagined what could happen to someone who’s a civilian? What could happen to Teoh Beng Hock? What could have happened? It would have been frightening, because here I am a lawyer, it’s still frightening to me, what would it be to you?” he asked, referring to the July 2009 death of the DAP political aide after being questioned as a witness in a graft probe. That night, Rosli felt as if he had sunk to the lowest point in his life, feeling as if God had “forsaken” him, even as he felt humiliated by the treatment he received. Later he found out that his wife and young children had waited until past midnight at the ACA headquarters to see him, with his wife crying herself to sleep after hearing that he would be charged in court the next day. At this point of the story, Rosli said his wife’s account made him “very sad” and “angry.” The next morning, Rosli was charged for allegedly failing to comply with ACA notices to declare his assets, and he related his wife’s narration of how sad she felt seeing him paraded in court like a “common criminal” in the presence of the media, in what she felt was an attempt to shame and embarrass him. Six years on, Rosli still remembers every scene in this nightmare vividly, and the constant tone was one of disbelief. “Not once in my life as a lawyer having practised for 25 years then could I imagine then that could have happened to me... in fact I was wondering what had I done wrong actually. I couldn’t understand,” the 52-year-old senior partner of one of Malaysia’s most established law firms said. Rosli’s case was tied to his client, the former Commercial Crimes Investigation Department (CCID) director Datuk Ramli Yusuff, with the lawyer then implicated of allegedly holding RM27 million worth of assets for his client. But Rosli points out that Ramli himself was then not even identified or charged, while he was “arrested, brutalised and charged” while acting as the lawyer for the senior policeman. And by March 2010, the main suspect Ramli was already acquitted, Rosli points out, with his own attempts to get the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (the new name for ACA) to withdraw the 2007 charge against him proving unsuccessful. “If I was a witness to someone’s wrongdoing and if that person is already not guilty, acquitted, should I also not be not guilty? And that is what I couldn’t understand,” he said, while also maintaining his stand in his September 20, 2007 statutory declaration that he does not hold any assets for Ramli. Even after Rosli himself was acquitted in December 20, 2010, the “mocking” about his assets lingered on until today, and he also spoke sadly of acquaintances and friends testifying in court of their doubts over his honesty after reading news reports hinting that he had allegedly hidden RM27 million for Ramli. Saying that his family was now “slowly recovering”, he hinted that the episode was so “hurtful” that they did not discuss it, adding that his wife’s recent witness statement caused him to realise that the “impact was very deep.” “Of course when you win, things change, but just imagine those five years, having the AG appealing, there was fear, the children had fears, would something happen to their father?” he said, referring to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC)’s appeal against his acquittal, which it subsequently dropped in August 2, 2012 after Rosli filed two affidavits to disclose what he alleged were blackmail attempts by the MACC. Rosli said the ordeal took its toll on his confidence, explaining that this was due to his arrest for what he called a “non-offence” despite his efforts to co-operate with the ACA and comply with the law. “That eroded a large part of my confidence for the past five years. That’s why I couldn’t function well, I couldn’t advise people properly, I took less cases because I was worried I was advising wrongly,” he said, although he has since successfully won a high-profile judicial review suit filed by Berjaya Books and two employees of Borders Bookstore. But is Rosli suing the AG out of anger and revenge? He admits to being an angry and sad man then, but now all he wants to do is seek closure and move on. Tired of the years of court cases—including three defamation suits against newspapers which he won—that has also cost him hundreds of thousands of ringgit, Rosli said his offer to settle the matter with the MACC was turned down. “I was waiting in some way they will come around and say ‘yes we have done you some wrong, let’s put this matter to an end, let’s settle the matter’ but they didn’t want to settle,” he said when explaining why he had waited until last month to file his suit. Claiming that there was “no independence” between the different government bodies, Rosli cited former MACC panel member Tan Sri Robert Phang’s sworn statement last year, where the latter said the MACC was prevented by the AG from discontinuing the 2007 case despite being aware that it would result in an acquittal. “It is no longer out of anger but to achieve closure to something that started six years ago because clearly what happened indicated that between the MACC, police, AG Chambers unfortunately there’s no check and balance,” Rosli said. He said he is now seeking justice not just for himself, but also wants to prevent those in power from causing others to suffer the same fate as him. “The recent suit is about putting checks and balances against abuses by those whom I considered to have failed and breached the trust that is reposed in them. “And if I don’t file such a suit, they will think there’s no consequences to what they do and that is why I sued them personally as well. When you hold office, you can’t hide behind the powers of your office,” he said, stressing that public powers must be used in good faith and that those in power should not abuse the system. Rosli’s suit was filed on November 22 against 11 respondents including the AG Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail, former Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Tan Sri Musa Hassan, current Malaysia Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief Tan Sri Abu Kassim Mohamed, former ACA head of prosecutions Datuk Nordin Hassan, MACC director of prosecutions Datuk Abdul Razak Musa. Three MACC officers—Kevin Anthony Morais, Chew Kam Soon, Saiful Ezral Ariffin—and the police force, the MACC and the government were also sued in the same suit, where Rosli is seeking damages totalling RM47 million or other amount to be fixed by the court, as well as special damages of RM750,000.

{"text": "SHAH ALAM: The wife of an Indian national businessman told the Datuk Sosilawati Lawiya murder trial that her husband never returned after going to Malaysia to meet the first accused, N Pathmanabhan, two years ago. S. Usharani, 26, from Chennai, said A. Muthuraja left for Malaysia on Jan 18, 2010 after receiving a call from Pathmanabhan. Asked how she knew about the call, Usharani said Muthuraja's telephone was in the loudspeaker mode when he received the call from Pathmanabhan on Jan 16, 2010. DPP Saiful Edris Zainuddin: You said Pathmanabhan made the call. Do you know him? Usharani: Yes. I know him because when I gave birth to my child, Pathmanabhan came to India to visit me in 2007. Asked to identify the person, she pointed to Pathmanabhan who was in the dock. Usharani was testifying in the trial of former lawyer Pathmanabhan and three farm workers, T. Thilaiyalagan, R. Matan and R. Khatavarayan , who are charged with murdering Sosilawati, 47, bank officer Noorhisham Mohamad, 38, lawyer Ahmad Kamil Abdul Karim, 32, and Sosilawati's driver, Kamaruddin Shamsuddin, 44. They are charged with committing the offence at Lot 2001, Jalan Tanjong Layang, Tanjung Sepat in Banting between 8.30pm and 9.45pm on Aug 30, 2010. Usharani said that her husband contacted her at noon on Jan 18, 2010 after arriving in Malaysia and the last call she received from him was about 10pm the same day. In the telephone conversation, he (Muthuraja) said that he was with Pathmanabhan and told me to take good care of our child and he would return to India in two days, she added. Saiful Edris: Did Muthuraja say who fetched him when he arrived in Malaysia? Usharani: Pathmanabhan Saiful Edris: Did he (Muthuraja) say where he was going when arriving in Malaysia? Usharani: No She said she called Muthuraja on Jan 19, 2010, but the calls went to the voice mail and until today, she could not contact him and did not know his whereabouts. Usharani said her husband would come to Malaysia about three times a year and on every trip would meet with Pathmanabhan. Saiful Edris: How do you know? Usharani: Because when in Malaysia, my husband will call me from Pathmanabhan's house. Pathmanabhan's mother, sister and siblings also told me so. Usharani said she lodged a missing person's report on her husband at the Banting police station in September 2010. Asked as to the delay in lodging the report, Usharani said it was because Pathmanabhan and his brother, Surendran, did not allow her to do so and they told her that her husband was detained for a land offence. Saiful Edris: Did you try to contact Pathmanabhan and Surendran when you failed to contact your husband? Usharani: Yes, I contacted Surendran to ask him where my husband was and he said he did not know. Surendran said he wanted to go to India. Asked whether she contacted Pathmanabhan, Usharani said she tried to contact him on Jan 20, 2010, but could not reach him and when she asked Surendran, she was told that Pathmanabhan was in Kathmandu, Nepal and he (Surendran) gave her his (Pathmanabhan) contact number there. When she did manage to contact Pathmanabhan, he told her that he did not know where Muthuraja was. During cross-examination, lawyer Manjeet Singh Dhillon questioned Usharani's status as Muthuraja's wife because in her passport Muthuraja's name was not stated as her husband. Manjeet Singh: Do you know that in India a Hindu can only have one wife? Usharani: Disagree Manjeet Singh: Muthuraja's mother, first wife and siblings are not in good terms with you? Usharani: Disagree Manjeet Singh: You are a Hindu and has a red 'pottu' on your forehead. A woman who is married wears the 'pottu' when the husband is still alive. Usharani: Yes Manjeet Singh: You wear the 'pottu' because you believe your husband is still alive? Usharani: I don't know She disagreed with Manjeet who said that her husband left her for another woman.

{"text": "Karpal said Karpal Singh pointed out that the constitutionality of the Penang mufti’s announcement on the ban on non-Muslims from using 40 Arabic words could be challenged in court. — Picture by Choo Choy May KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 12 — DAP’s Karpal Singh urged the Penang state government today to clarify the legality of a shariah enactment there prohibiting non-Muslims from referring to God as “Allah”, after a decree by the state Mufti threatens to plunge the Sikhs into the ongoing row over the Arabic word. The senior lawyer said the move was necessary even as he pointed out that the constitutionality of the Penang mufti’s announcement on the ban on non-Muslims from using 40 Arabic words could be challenged in court. “In the Sikh Bible, the word ‘Allah’ appears 37 times,” said Karpal in a statement today. “The Sikhs have used the word ‘Allah’ in Penang and elsewhere in the world from time immemorial without any objection from any quarter, and rightly so, having regard to the guarantee of freedom of religion under Articles 3(1) and 11(1) of the Federal Constitution. The Penang Mufti’s prohibition of that word by Sikhs in the state, therefore, is of no consequence or avail,” added the DAP national chairman. Besides the Sikh holy book, the word “Allah” is also found in the Bahasa Malaysia translation of the Christian bible, the Al-Kitab. English daily the New Straits Times reported yesterday the Penang mufti as prohibiting non-Muslims from using Arabic words like “Allah”, “iman” (faith) and “nabi” (prophet) under the Administration of Religion of Islam (State of Penang) Enactment 2004. That law, however, is not a secular state legislation like other similar laws in other states in Malaysia, according to senior lawyer Roger Tan who wrote a commentary in The Star today. Tan wrote in the English daily that a fatwa on the exclusivity of certain words to Islam may have been issued under the 2004 Penang shariah law, but that it is not binding on non-Muslims. The Selangor Non-Islamic Religions (Control of Propagation Among Muslims) Enactment 1988 places a blanket ban on non-Muslims from using 35 Arabic words and phrases, including “Allah”. The law was recently used by the Selangor Islamic Religious Department (Jais) to seize over 300 copies of Malay and Iban-language bibles from the Bible Society of Malaysia (BSM) on January 2. There are similar secular enactments in nine other states, except in Penang, Sabah, Sarawak and the Federal Territories. Tan questioned the constitutionality of such laws, pointing out that legislation can only be enacted to specifically prohibit the proselytisation of non-Muslim faiths to Muslims, under Article 11(4) of the Federal Constitution. “But the states do not have the power to make laws controlling or restricting, let alone prohibiting, the use of certain words and expressions without any act of propagation. In other words, a state law can only be enacted to proscribe a Christian from delivering a Bible which contains the word ‘Allah’ to a Muslim, and not if the former uses the same Bible for his own personal belief,” he wrote. The lawyer also wrote that Section 9 of such state laws, which detail the ban, violates one’s constitutional rights to freedom of religion and free speech. “Having said that, Section 9 is still a valid law unless repealed or amended by the respective state legislature. In the alternative, anyone can challenge its validity but he must first obtain leave from a Federal Court judge under Article 4 (4) unless the challenge comes from the federal or state government,” said Tan. He also stressed that non-Muslims cannot be charged in a shariah court, but only in a civil court. “It would certainly be in order for the Penang state government to seek legal advice on the prohibition announced by the Penang Mufti before any non-Muslim is charged for an offence for use of the words prohibited,” Karpal said in relation to Tan’s remark. The tussle over “Allah” has so far been largely restricted to Muslims and Christians, although the Arabic word also exists in the holy books of other religions.", "labels": [[0, 6, "ORG"], [12, 24, "PERSON"], [71, 77, "ORG"], [113, 124, "NORP"], [136, 145, "QUANTITY"], [195, 204, "PERSON"], [223, 229, "DATE"], [238, 250, "ORG"], [261, 267, "GPE"], [285, 290, "DATE"], [356, 367, "NORP"], [430, 435, "PERSON"], [460, 465, "NORP"], [496, 502, "NORP"], [612, 618, "GPE"], [654, 665, "NORP"], [677, 686, "QUANTITY"], [727, 741, "WORK_OF_ART"], [768, 770, "CARDINAL"], [784, 790, "PERSON"], [806, 811, "DATE"], [818, 823, "NORP"], [854, 860, "GPE"], [936, 947, "DATE"], [1025, 1037, "FAC"], [1052, 1076, "LAW"], [1125, 1130, "NORP"], [1233, 1237, "GPE"], [1287, 1302, "LOC"], [1322, 1331, "NORP"], [1343, 1351, "PERSON"], [1353, 1360, "NORP"], [1361, 1366, "DATE"], [1367, 1388, "ORG"], [1398, 1407, "DATE"], [1412, 1418, "GPE"], [1440, 1451, "NORP"], [1463, 1469, "NORP"], [1532, 1571, "ORG"], [1600, 1604, "DATE"], [1703, 1711, "GPE"], [1740, 1749, "PERSON"], [1776, 1784, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1785, 1790, "DATE"], [1792, 1795, "PERSON"], [1809, 1816, "NORP"], [1875, 1880, "ORG"], [1912, 1916, "DATE"], [1917, 1923, "ORG"], [1967, 1978, "NORP"], [1980, 2014, "ORG"], [2045, 2052, "NORP"], [2093, 2104, "NORP"], [2116, 2125, "QUANTITY"], [2193, 2234, "ORG"], [2236, 2240, "PERSON"], [2256, 2259, "CARDINAL"], [2270, 2275, "GPE"], [2306, 2335, "ORG"], [2337, 2340, "ORG"], [2345, 2354, "DATE"], [2396, 2400, "CARDINAL"], [2425, 2431, "GPE"], [2433, 2438, "GPE"], [2452, 2475, "GPE"], [2477, 2480, "PERSON"], [2626, 2636, "NORP"], [2647, 2654, "NORP"], [2662, 2674, "LAW"], [2679, 2703, "LAW"], [2943, 2952, "NORP"], [2971, 2976, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3014, 3020, "NORP"], [3058, 3063, "WORK_OF_ART"], [3131, 3140, "LAW"], [3279, 3288, "LAW"], [3466, 3479, "ORG"], [3492, 3504, "LAW"], [3577, 3580, "PERSON"], [3604, 3615, "NORP"], [3721, 3727, "GPE"], [3802, 3814, "PERSON"], [3826, 3836, "NORP"], [3897, 3903, "PERSON"], [3924, 3929, "FAC"], [4000, 4007, "NORP"], [4012, 4022, "NORP"], [4037, 4043, "NORP"]]}
{"text": "Children of Malaysian Muslim couple Azizul Raheem Awalludin and his wife Shalwati Nurshal with Malaysian Deputy Foreign Minister Datuk Hamzah Zainuddin after they arrived at Kuala Lumpur on February 1, 2014. — AFP pic KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 23 — The ongoing trial of a Malaysian couple charged in Sweden with hitting their children has raised a pertinent question: is it time to put away the rod when disciplining minors? Parents here are divided. Some believe that spanking still has its place, especially when dealing with wilfully disobedient children; others say that physical punishment begets violence. “For Muslims, it’s acceptable, as long as you don’t beat them up,” said mother of three, Azalina Azamuddin. The 35-year-old said the Quran allows the caning of children, aged above seven, for not praying, and said Malaysia should not follow Sweden’s example in totally abolishing corporal punishment. However, she said certain limits can be introduced. “There should be an extent to what kind of level you can enforce your right as parents, and not totally abuse them,” Azalina told The Malay Mail Online in a phone interview. Azalina, who works as an investigation executive, said it was difficult to avoid using physical punishment when disciplining her children aged between seven and 11, but added that she only caned them when they fought among themselves or talked back to her, and even then on the legs or buttocks, never above the waist. Julia Yeow, also 35, shared a similar view, saying Malaysia should not ban caning or fix the method of discipline, adding that parents should be able to decide how to deal with their disobedient offspring. “By outlawing something, the government is effectively taking away caregivers’ right of choosing the best methods for their child,” said Yeow, whose three children are all below seven years old. The working mother said she and her husband had previously used a wooden spoon to lightly smack their children but now use a cane on the two older boys — now aged six and three — when they “cross certain lines”, hitting them only on the palms and buttocks. The sub-editor said they did use other methods apart from corporal punishment, and always explained to the children why they were being disciplined. “My eldest is very compliant, so we rarely, if ever, need to cane him. My second is totally opposite, so harsher methods do work better with him,” she said. Julian Hopkins, an Irish lecturer who has been living here for 12 years, said he has never spanked or physically punished his children. “I don’t want to teach them to use violence towards other people,” said the father of two boys aged two and four. Instead, he disciplines his older child by making him go to his room, or telling the four-year-old to sit on the sofa for five minutes. “At his age, the fact that you’re unhappy with him is the biggest punishment you can give because children seek our approval,” he said. Hopkins said he knows of parents who resort to corporal punishment on children the same age as his own, but added, “I don’t see a significant difference in their behaviour. It’s not necessary and it’s probably damaging in the long term.” The 44-year-old suggested that a more effective method of disciplining older children was to withhold their pocket money or ground them. The Irishman said physical punishment, whether in schools or in prison, should be prohibited in Malaysia. Malaysian teacher Shalwati Norshal and her husband Azizul Raheem Awaluddin, a Tourism Malaysia official based in Stockholm, were charged with committing gross violation of integrity against their four children — aged between seven and 14 years — and with assault. According to statements by their children, Shalwati was accused of hitting them at their home in Stockholm for several years, even with items like a piece of wood, a coat hanger, canes, a carpet beater and a belt. The couple was detained on December 18 last year after being accused of beating their children for not praying. Sweden outlawed corporal punishment in 1979, the first country in the world to do so.

{"text": "A view of one building in Tanjung Sutera Resort. — Picture courtesy of tripadvisor KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 17 — Putrajaya’s unprecedented move to strip a Singaporean man of his permanent residence (PR) status for allowing a group of Buddhist tourists to meditate in a Muslim prayer room at his resort, was excessive and unnecessary, several lawyers said today. The lawyers also warned the federal government that it had set itself up for a potential lawsuit, should the man choose to challenge the revocation. Eric Paulsen, co-founder and advisor of legal group, Lawyers for Liberty, told The Malay Mail Online that the government’s announcement today seemed to be done in “extreme haste” and is an irrational move. “Because what [the home minister] had done is punishing the resort operator, through the back door. “So now even before he is found guilty, the authorities have found ways through the back door to punish him,” he said over the phone. The holiday resort owner in Sedili Besar, near Kota Tinggi, was released on police bail yesterday, after being remanded for four days to facilitate investigations into him allowing the resort’s surau to be used for a Buddhist religious ceremony. Johor police had said that the investigation papers of the case were, however, being finalised and had yet to be submitted to the public prosecutor for further action. Today, Home Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi announced that the Singaporean’s PR has been revoked, effective immediately. Paulsen said the home ministry’s action has a serious affect on the Singaporean, and that this matter should not be taken lightly. “He should at least be afforded the opportunity to be heard. “It is now open for him to challenge this decision in court,” the lawyer said. Civil liberties lawyer Syahredzan Johan also deemed the home minister’s action as “excessive and unnecessary”. “We have to remember this person has not been charged in court for anything and he has not been tried or found guilty of anything. “When the government revokes his PR status what the government is essentially doing is punishing him before anything has been proven against him, even before he is allowed to defend himself,” he told The Malay Mail Online over the phone. “They should have charged the person in court and try to prove the case against him, instead of going about this way because this is arbitrary. “This is excessive and arbitrary and disregarding his right to be heard,” he said. Syahredzan said the government should consider the repercussions from such a harsh decision. “If the government wants to encourage people to come to Malaysia, here we have this person coming to Malaysia to operate a resort, when most Malaysians have gone to Singapore to work, we need these kind of people to work and invest in the country. “We cannot have a culture of arbitrary punishment without allowing the person to defend themselves,” he said. He acknowledged that the government has the jurisdiction to revoke one’s PR visa but he said those powers must be exercised accordingly. “At least [the resort operator] should try to assert his rights in court rather than just allow something like this to happen,” he said. Paulsen also said that the decision today will affect foreigners considering to have businesses here or foreigners whom might consider Malaysia as a second home. “The government must a take a more measured approach in handling these cases against Islam even though we understand the government’s position that Islam is the official religion. “This decision has a serious repercussion in terms of economic interests, investments, tourism and how the world sees Malaysia. “I urge the authorities to not overreact and act emotionally, and to look through the rules and regulation to provide justice,” he said. Datuk Ambiga Sreenevasan, a prominent civil rights activist and former Bar Council president expressed her shock over the Home Minister’s announcement “Shocking move! Better have guidebook for foreigners coming here. If anyone still wants to come,” she posted on her Twitter account just minutes after the news was announced.", "labels": [[10, 13, "CARDINAL"], [26, 47, "LOC"], [83, 95, "ORG"], [101, 103, "CARDINAL"], [148, 159, "NORP"], [227, 235, "NORP"], [262, 268, "NORP"], [348, 353, "DATE"], [504, 516, "PERSON"], [557, 576, "ORG"], [583, 604, "ORG"], [624, 626, "ORG"], [640, 645, "DATE"], [972, 984, "GPE"], [991, 1002, "PERSON"], [1032, 1041, "DATE"], [1068, 1077, "DATE"], [1161, 1169, "NORP"], [1190, 1195, "PERSON"], [1358, 1363, "DATE"], [1379, 1389, "PERSON"], [1393, 1411, "PERSON"], [1427, 1447, "ORG"], [1489, 1496, "PERSON"], [1519, 1521, "PERSON"], [1557, 1568, "NORP"], [1783, 1799, "PERSON"], [1829, 1831, "PERSON"], [2616, 2624, "GPE"], [2661, 2669, "GPE"], [2701, 2711, "NORP"], [2725, 2734, "GPE"], [2985, 2988, "CARDINAL"], [2988, 2993, "ORG"], [3192, 3199, "PERSON"], [3228, 3233, "DATE"], [3327, 3335, "GPE"], [3341, 3347, "ORDINAL"], [3439, 3444, "ORG"], [3502, 3507, "ORG"], [3652, 3660, "GPE"], [3799, 3823, "PERSON"], [3870, 3881, "ORG"], [4087, 4094, "TIME"]]}
{"text": "The Federal Constitution disqualifies any lawmaker who receives a fine of over RM2,000 or a jail sentence of more than one year from holding public office as an elected representative. — Picture by Mohd Yusof Mat Isa KUALA LUMPUR, March 11 — Veteran DAP MP Karpal Singh was today fined RM4,000 by the High Court here for sedition, putting the 73-year-old at risk of losing his Bukit Gelugor seat. While the Federal Constitution disqualifies any lawmaker who receives a fine of over RM2,000 or a jail sentence of more than one year from holding public office as an elected representative, Malaysian Bar president Chris Leong said Karpal can still keep his seat pending an appeal to a court. “Under the Federal Constitution, a sitting member of Parliament will not be disqualified until all avenues of appeal have been exhausted and determined,” Leong, who was one of the lawyers holding a watching brief for the Bar Council, told reporters here after the court decision today. High Court judge Datuk Paduka Azman Abdullah handed down the sentence after over two hours of arguments by Karpal’s defence team and the prosecution, which saw heated exchanges between the two. Charged under Section 4 (1) (b) of the Sedition Act 1948, the Bukit Gelugor MP faced a maximum fine of RM5,000 or three years’ jail, or both. But while Azman noted the need for deterrent sentences, he took into account two medical reports on Karpal’s health when deciding not to impose any jail sentence on the latter. When presenting arguments to mitigate Karpal’s sentence, his daughter and lawyer Sangeet Kaur mentioned a 2005 motor accident that left the politician wheelchair bound and in need of various medical treatments. The decision was handed down in a courtroom packed with top Pakatan Rakyat (PR) leaders and supporters, media personnel, lawyers and other observers. A row of benches was added, while others stood and filled up the courtroom’s side aisles. Earlier, the judge decided not to hear submissions by the Bar Council and the Commonwealth Lawyers’ Association, who wanted to present arguments in favour of mitigating Karpal’s sentence. Besides the Bar Council — represented by Leong, the Bar’s vice-president Steven Thiru, Datuk Baljit Singh Sidhu; the Commonwealth Lawyers Association and Lawasia held watching briefs through Datuk Cyrus Das and Mark Trowell. In the final stages of the proceedings earlier, deputy public prosecutor Noorin Badaruddin argued that it would amount to an “insult to the royal institution” if the court only hands down a light sentence or a disproportionate sentence. This prompted Karpal’s son Gobind Singh Deo, who is also part of the defence team, to accuse the prosecution team of “threatening” the court into imposing a heavy sentence, which resulted in the judge expunging or striking out several paragraphs in Noorin’s submission from the court’s record. On February 21 this year, Karpal was found guilty of sedition over his remarks on the Perak Sultan’s role in the 2009 state constitutional crisis. Following the fresh trial after the prosecution’s successful appeal of Karpal’s previous acquittal, the judge ruled last month that the defence had failed to raise reasonable doubt. In 2010, the DAP national chairman had been acquitted by Azman without having to enter his defence over the sedition charge stemming from a press conference in February 2009 in which he said the Perak Ruler’s decision to remove Datuk Seri Nizar Jamaluddin as mentri besar in favour of Datuk Seri Zambry Abdul Kadir was open to legal challenge. The prosecution later appealed the acquittal successfully in 2012, insisting that Azman took a flawed approach in arriving at his decision then. In 2009, three Pakatan Rakyat (PR) lawmakers defected to become pro-Barisan Nasional (BN) independents, which caused the state won by the informal pact in Election 2008 to fall back into the hands of the latter coalition. Karpal’s conviction last month had attracted criticism, with critics pointing out that Putrajaya had continued to use the Sedition Act despite previously promising in July 2012 to repeal the now 66-year-old law. A number of federal opposition (PR) politicians and activists were also charged last year under the Sedition Act.", "labels": [[0, 24, "LAW"], [79, 86, "PRODUCT"], [109, 127, "DATE"], [198, 208, "PERSON"], [213, 229, "PERSON"], [231, 239, "DATE"], [257, 269, "PERSON"], [274, 279, "DATE"], [286, 293, "CARDINAL"], [297, 311, "ORG"], [377, 390, "PERSON"], [403, 427, "LAW"], [482, 489, "PRODUCT"], [512, 530, "DATE"], [588, 597, "NORP"], [612, 623, "PERSON"], [629, 635, "ORG"], [697, 721, "LAW"], [743, 753, "ORG"], [844, 849, "PERSON"], [859, 862, "CARDINAL"], [907, 922, "ORG"], [969, 974, "DATE"], [976, 986, "ORG"], [993, 1020, "PERSON"], [1057, 1066, "TIME"], [1083, 1091, "ORG"], [1165, 1168, "CARDINAL"], [1184, 1193, "LAW"], [1205, 1226, "LAW"], [1273, 1280, "PRODUCT"], [1284, 1295, "DATE"], [1322, 1327, "ORG"], [1389, 1392, "CARDINAL"], [1412, 1420, "ORG"], [1527, 1535, "ORG"], [1570, 1582, "PERSON"], [1595, 1599, "DATE"], [1760, 1774, "ORG"], [1924, 1926, "ORG"], [1994, 2009, "ORG"], [2014, 2051, "ORG"], [2109, 2117, "ORG"], [2136, 2153, "ORG"], [2169, 2174, "PERSON"], [2201, 2213, "PERSON"], [2215, 2239, "ORG"], [2241, 2277, "ORG"], [2282, 2289, "GPE"], [2319, 2324, "NORP"], [2325, 2334, "PERSON"], [2339, 2351, "PERSON"], [2426, 2443, "PERSON"], [2604, 2612, "ORG"], [2617, 2633, "PERSON"], [2839, 2847, "ORG"], [2887, 2908, "DATE"], [2910, 2916, "PERSON"], [2997, 3001, "DATE"], [3102, 3110, "ORG"], [3147, 3157, "DATE"], [3216, 3220, "DATE"], [3226, 3229, "ORG"], [3270, 3275, "ORG"], [3373, 3386, "DATE"], [3404, 3421, "ORG"], [3441, 3468, "PERSON"], [3498, 3503, "GPE"], [3516, 3527, "PERSON"], [3618, 3622, "DATE"], [3639, 3644, "ORG"], [3705, 3709, "DATE"], [3711, 3716, "CARDINAL"], [3717, 3731, "ORG"], [3766, 3790, "FAC"], [3857, 3870, "DATE"], [3924, 3930, "ORG"], [3944, 3954, "DATE"], [4011, 4020, "ORG"], [4042, 4058, "LAW"], [4091, 4100, "DATE"], [4216, 4225, "DATE"], [4232, 4248, "LAW"]]}
{"text": "Bukit Bendera MP Zairil Khir Johari said prosecuting a Christian Indonesian under the shariah law was a clear example of moral policing gone awry.. — Photo by Saw Siow Feng GEORGE TOWN, March 19 — The conviction of a non-Muslim for close proximity in the Shariah Court is a gross abuse of power, Penang Pakatan Rakyat (PR) leaders said today. They were appalled that an Indonesian Christian woman was arrested, charged and subsequently convicted of close proximity, known as khalwat, under Islamic laws which they stress are enforceable only on Muslims in the country. “It is extremely wrong to use shariah laws on non-Muslims, there is no basis for this and it constitutes a gross abuse of power,” Bukit Bendera MP Zairil Khir Johari said. Zairil also said the case is a clear example of moral policing gone awry. “Moral policing is also not what Islam is all about. Islam at its most fundamental is a religion that promotes freedom of thought and conscience,” he said. He added that any attempt to suppress Muslims and control them would always elicit the opposite result. “The Quran itself stressed that no one can be forced or compelled in matters of faith,” he said, referring to al-Baqarah verse 256 in the Quran. It was not clear why the JAIPP enforcement officers had arrested Halimah and charged her in shariah court but it was believed that they assumed she is a Muslim due to her Malay name. “Judging people by their names is not something intuitive at all, for example, a Turkish visitor to Malaysia once told me that he is surprised that there are many Muslims in Malaysia named Sofia, whereas in Turkey, it is a name that only Christians would use,” Zairil said. Zairil was commenting on 42-year-old Halimah’s case where she was arrested by the Penang Islamic Religious Affairs Department (JAIPP) officers in 2011 while she was at work at a reflexology centre. Halimah, who is a Christian, was convicted of close proximity with a man who is not her husband or relative and she was fined RM3,000 and jailed 14 days. The shariah court allowed her a stay of execution pending her appeal against the conviction and sentence so she is now out on bail. State executive councillor Dr Afif Bahardin agreed with Zairil that the shariah court has no jurisdiction to impose Islamic laws on those of other faiths. “We should go back to the Federal Constitution that clearly upholds freedom, individual rights and liberty so if we are talking about people trying to impose their religious values on those of other faiths, it is against the constitution,” he said. Bukit Mertajam MP Steven Sim believed that the Islamic religious authorities in Malaysia are becoming careless and indiscriminate in their overzealous actions against non-Muslims. He likened this action against a Christian to that of the raid on the Bible Society of Malaysia by the Selangor Islamic Religious Affairs Department early this year. “Indiscriminate actions such as this are making the already tense inter-racial, inter-religious situation worse,” he said. Sim stressed that the Islamic religious authorities do not have any authority over non-Muslims and non-Islamic matters even though Islam is the religion of the federation. “If a non-Muslim commits an offence, bring her to the civil courts so if Halimah broke any law, bring her to the proper forum for justice,” he said. He said it is unreasonable, illogical and unjust to subject a Christian to Islamic religious laws. Halimah’s appeal was heard in the shariah high court last year but the high court maintainted the conviction and sentence. Her lawyer is now filing an application for leave to appeal to the shariah court of appeal, the final avenue for Halimah to appeal her case. Her lawyer had also submitted documents to prove that Halimah is born a Christian, that she was baptised and her family in Indonesia are all Christians. Her lawyer, Wan Faridulhadi Mohd Yusoff is hoping for the shariah court of appeal to strike out the case.", "labels": [[0, 13, "PERSON"], [17, 35, "PERSON"], [55, 75, "NORP"], [186, 194, "DATE"], [217, 227, "NORP"], [251, 268, "ORG"], [296, 310, "PERSON"], [336, 341, "DATE"], [370, 380, "NORP"], [381, 390, "NORP"], [490, 497, "NORP"], [545, 552, "NORP"], [615, 626, "NORP"], [699, 712, "PERSON"], [716, 734, "PERSON"], [741, 747, "DATE"], [848, 853, "ORG"], [868, 873, "ORG"], [1009, 1016, "NORP"], [1080, 1085, "ORG"], [1185, 1195, "ORG"], [1213, 1218, "ORG"], [1245, 1250, "ORG"], [1285, 1292, "ORG"], [1373, 1379, "NORP"], [1391, 1396, "NORP"], [1484, 1491, "NORP"], [1503, 1511, "GPE"], [1566, 1573, "NORP"], [1577, 1585, "GPE"], [1592, 1597, "GPE"], [1610, 1616, "GPE"], [1641, 1651, "NORP"], [1664, 1670, "PERSON"], [1677, 1683, "DATE"], [1714, 1723, "PERSON"], [1755, 1802, "ORG"], [1804, 1809, "ORG"], [1823, 1827, "DATE"], [1875, 1882, "PERSON"], [1893, 1902, "NORP"], [2001, 2008, "PRODUCT"], [2020, 2027, "DATE"], [2191, 2204, "PERSON"], [2217, 2223, "DATE"], [2277, 2284, "NORP"], [2338, 2362, "LAW"], [2565, 2579, "PERSON"], [2583, 2593, "PERSON"], [2612, 2619, "NORP"], [2645, 2653, "GPE"], [2732, 2743, "NORP"], [2778, 2787, "NORP"], [2811, 2840, "ORG"], [2844, 2893, "ORG"], [2894, 2909, "DATE"], [3056, 3063, "NORP"], [3117, 3128, "NORP"], [3133, 3144, "NORP"], [3165, 3170, "ORG"], [3212, 3222, "NORP"], [3279, 3286, "ORG"], [3417, 3426, "NORP"], [3430, 3437, "NORP"], [3454, 3463, "ORG"], [3507, 3516, "DATE"], [3690, 3697, "ORG"], [3772, 3779, "ORG"], [3790, 3799, "NORP"], [3841, 3850, "GPE"], [3859, 3869, "NORP"], [3883, 3910, "PERSON"]]}
{"text": "File picture shows Azmi Sharom (left) from Universiti Malaya's Faculty of Law speaking at the CIJ 2012-2013 Freedom of Expression report at KLSCAH on February 20, 2014. — Picture by Choo Choy May PETALING JAYA, Sept 25 — After Putrajaya’s use of the Sedition Act against a University of Malaya (UM) law lecturer turned members of the academia here skittish, the country’s oldest tertiary institution’s academics urged their fellow scholars not to bow to their fears and to continue airing their opinions boldly in order to keep the space for public discourse open. Prof Dr Edmund Terence Gomez said that academics “should not be fearful” and “self-censor” themselves in Malaysia, which he described earlier as a “quasi-democracy” or an “electoral authoritarian society”. “The Sedition Act is creating a climate of fear, we cannot succumb to this fear. We cannot let it affect us to the point we self-censor,” the political economist from UM’s faculty of economics and administration told a forum here last night. He expressed his concern that the “stifling of academic freedom” in UM and other universities would impair the academics’ scholarships as they would begin self-censoring and carefully guard their words when delivering their lectures. “That is no way to run a university, that is no way to debate ideas if we ourselves self-censor,” said Gomez. Fellow panellist Dr Surinderpal Kaur said Malaysians are living in an “intolerant society”, which has led to a lack of liberalism and in turn, a self-censorship of opinions that “do not jive” with the dominant group’s opinions. But public and legal discourse is a “very fertile ground for discussion and debate” and sharing of opinions that, “unfortunately is being narrowed” in Malaysia, Surinderpal said. “That is something we need to question, we need to push the boundaries of that particular ground. “The more silent we keep, that ground is going to get narrower and narrower until the point we really will be unable to speak up or say anything,” the senior lecturer from UM’s faculty of language and linguistics warned. Prof Gurdial Singh Nijar noted the “chilling effect” of the use of the Sedition Act where students feel they need to “shut up” while academics may “self-censor”, but said all these results from a “vicious cycle” where scholars had previously failed to defend academic freedom. Earlier, Gomez also described Malaysia as a “quasi-democracy” or “electoral authoritarian society” before underlining the need to defend academic freedom. “If we have elections every four or five years and that is why we are called a democracy, that is not enough. We have no freedom of speech, we have no freedom of assembly and now very soon we will have no academic freedom,” he said. The forum panellists called on academics and scholars to lead the way in striving for academic freedom, with Gomez citing Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan and South Korea where students had driven efforts for democracy in the 1980s. “We need to get back into the forefront, be in the forefront of bringing about change,” he later said. University of Malaya Student Union (PMUM)’s elected representative Fiona Lim Cho Ching, a final year law student who is also Azmi’s student, also spoke at the forum last night. The forum titled “Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expression” was jointly organised by PMUM and UM Academic Staff Association (PKAUM). On September 2, UM’s Associate Prof Dr Azmi Sharom was charged with sedition for merely giving his academic opinion on the 2009 Perak constitutional crisis and saying that the events then was “legally wrong”. If convicted under either the first charge of Section 4(1)(b) or the alternative charge of Section 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act, the 45-year-old law lecturer will face a maximum fine of RM5,000 or a maximum jail term of three years or both. Two others – Muhammad Safwan Anang and Adam Adli Abdul Halim – have been convicted of sedition this month and given a 10-month jail term and 12-month jail term respectively.

{"text": "If found guilty, Lawyer, N. Surendran faces a fine of up to RM5,000, a maximum three-year jail term, or both. ― Picture by Yusof Mat Isa KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 17 — Opposition MP N. Surendran will only know on Friday if he will succeed in challenging his sedition charge at a higher court, after the Sessions Court deferred announcing a decision today. Judge Ahmad Bache said he will need to go through the lengthy submissions on the preliminary objection to the application before making a ruling. “I will need some time. I will read the decision on Friday, 3pm,” he said after hearing the submissions from Surendran’s lawyer M. Puravalen and deputy public prosecutor Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin. Surendran who is one of PKR’s three vice-presidents filed a challenge to the Sedition Act 1948 on September 18, arguing that the colonial-era law that was used against him had violated the Federal Constitution. On August 19, the Padang Serai MP was charged under Section 4 (1)(C) of the Sedition Act for criticising the Court of Appeal’s ruling that overturned a lower court’s decision to discharge Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim from his second sodomy charge. Surendran, who is Anwar’s lawyer, was accused of committing the offence in a news release titled “Court of Appeal’s Fitnah 2 Written Judgement is Flawed, Defensive & Insupportable” that was issued to news portal Malaysiakini on April 18 this year. If found guilty, Surendran faces a fine of up to RM5,000, a maximum three-year jail term, or both. Surendran also faces a second sedition charge under the same clause for an August 8 YouTube comment, where he allegedly accused the prime minister for being “personally responsible” for the alleged rushing of dates in the Federal Court’s hearing of Anwar’s second sodomy court case. Latheefa Koya, who is on Surendran’s legal team, said the Sedition Act is unconstitutional as it was not passed in Parliament, and has been in place before independence. The Federal Constitution states that only laws passed by elected lawmakers can restrict fundamental rights, she added. “Secondly, this law is extreme in trying to restrict one’s rights and thirdly, since this Sedition Act does not have the element of intent, this law is not constitutional,” she told reporters outside the courtroom. The lawyer pointed out that this same reason was used by the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) when it decided not to prosecute Perkasa chief Datuk Ibrahim Ali over his Bible-burning remarks. On October 27, the AG Chambers said no legal action was taken against Ibrahim “because he had no intention to create religious disharmony when he called for the burning of Bibles containing the word “Allah”. “If the prosecutor can use the element of lack of intent, it is consistent to say that when one is accused, there should be an intent. If there is no intent, then it is not constitutional. “We are also using the same reasoning to challenge the Sedition Act,” Latheefa said. Meanwhile, Deputy Public Prosecutor Wan Shaharuddin pointed out to court today that the question of the Sedition Act’s constitutionality had already been answered last year, citing the case of Sri Muda assemblyman Mat Shuhaimi Shafiei. Mat Shuhaimi, who was charged under Section 4 of the Act in 2011, had his application to strike out the case last year dismissed by the Court of Appeal, which declared the legislation constitutional. Surendran’s legal team, however, argued that since the case has yet to reach the highest court, the latest court decision should not be taken as the final ruling on the matter. Wan Shaharuddin, however, said it was not for the court to decide whether the charge is “unjust or not” as an individual should seek to amend the law, instead of challenging it in court. “If you are not satisfied with law, amend the law. I don’t want the laws in Malaysia to be a mockery,” he told the court. He added that the Sessions Court should be able to decide on the case without having to refer it to a higher court.", "labels": [[17, 23, "PERSON"], [25, 37, "PERSON"], [79, 89, "DATE"], [123, 149, "PERSON"], [174, 186, "PERSON"], [205, 211, "DATE"], [291, 309, "ORG"], [341, 346, "DATE"], [354, 365, "PERSON"], [546, 552, "DATE"], [554, 557, "QUANTITY"], [603, 612, "GPE"], [622, 634, "PERSON"], [664, 689, "PERSON"], [691, 700, "PERSON"], [708, 711, "CARDINAL"], [715, 718, "ORG"], [721, 726, "CARDINAL"], [764, 785, "LAW"], [789, 801, "DATE"], [876, 900, "LAW"], [905, 914, "DATE"], [920, 932, "PERSON"], [954, 969, "LAW"], [974, 990, "LAW"], [1007, 1028, "ORG"], [1065, 1067, "ORG"], [1090, 1114, "PERSON"], [1124, 1130, "ORDINAL"], [1146, 1155, "PERSON"], [1164, 1169, "PERSON"], [1244, 1288, "ORG"], [1292, 1325, "ORG"], [1358, 1370, "GPE"], [1374, 1392, "DATE"], [1411, 1420, "GPE"], [1462, 1472, "DATE"], [1493, 1502, "PERSON"], [1516, 1522, "ORDINAL"], [1568, 1576, "DATE"], [1711, 1730, "ORG"], [1742, 1749, "ORG"], [1750, 1756, "ORDINAL"], [1776, 1789, "PERSON"], [1801, 1810, "GPE"], [1830, 1846, "LAW"], [1891, 1901, "ORG"], [1946, 1970, "LAW"], [2066, 2074, "ORDINAL"], [2150, 2167, "LAW"], [2408, 2415, "ORG"], [2422, 2439, "PERSON"], [2449, 2454, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2475, 2485, "DATE"], [2487, 2502, "ORG"], [2542, 2549, "NORP"], [2644, 2650, "GPE"], [2920, 2936, "LAW"], [2939, 2947, "PERSON"], [2990, 3005, "PERSON"], [3027, 3032, "DATE"], [3054, 3072, "LAW"], [3117, 3126, "DATE"], [3147, 3155, "GPE"], [3168, 3188, "PERSON"], [3190, 3202, "PERSON"], [3226, 3246, "LAW"], [3250, 3254, "DATE"], [3299, 3308, "DATE"], [3322, 3341, "ORG"], [3390, 3399, "GPE"], [3567, 3582, "PERSON"], [3830, 3838, "GPE"], [3890, 3908, "ORG"]]}
{"text": "As with Syahredzan, lawyers New Sin Yew and Eric Paulsen said that legal immunity in Parliament was not absolute and lawmakers may still be liable for offences involving sedition. KUALA LUMPUR, March 17 — Parliamentary privilege that provides lawmakers with legal immunity to discuss matters freely in Parliament does not apply in cases involving the Sedition Act 1948. Instead, the colonial-era law that critics say is used to stifle dissent contains a rare exception that is able to pierce the legal protection that otherwise affords parliamentarians freedom from criminal or civil liability for speech made within the walls of the Dewan Rakyat. While Article 63(2) of the Federal Constitution states that lawmakers will not be liable for actions or speech that are part of parliamentary proceedings, a subsequent article countermands this for instances involving the Sedition Act 1948 and laws enacted under Article 10(4) that protect the national language, Bumiputera quotas and the Malay rulers. “What this means is that anything that you say in Parliament cannot be subjected to any criminal charge or cannot be questioned in any court at all,” civil liberties lawyer Syahredzan Johan told Malay Mail Online. “But Article 63(4) provides the exception and this was inserted after the race riot of 1969. So now although you have the privilege, there is an exception and the exception is that the privileges shall not apply to a person who’s charged under the Sedition Act.” PKR vice-president Nurul Izzah Anwar was arrested yesterday when she reported to the Dang Wangi police station to answer for allegedly seditious remarks she made in questioning the Federal Court’s decision to jail her father, Opposition Leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, when she read out his speech in Parliament. The Lembah Pantai MP’s arrest drew immediate protests against what was viewed as a violation of her parliamentary privilege. As with Syahredzan, lawyers New Sin Yew and Eric Paulsen said that legal immunity in Parliament was not absolute and lawmakers may still be liable for offences involving sedition. But both disagreed that Nurul Izzah was criminally liable for her remarks, contending that Article 63(4) allowed for very specific exceptions to parliamentary privilege under the Sedition Act 1948 as amended by the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance No. 45, 1970. According to New, the ordinance in question inserted a new definition of seditious tendency under Section 3(1)(f) of the Sedition Act, which is tendency to question the national language, Bumiputera special rights or the sovereignty of the Malay rulers. “Yes, because she (only) spoke on judiciary, political conspiracy. Privileges are applicable to her, that would be my reading,” Paulsen told Malay Mail Online. New went a step further to say that while the exception remained on paper, it was effectively non-existent as the particular definition of sedition no longer existed as Putrajaya’s lifting of all declared Emergencies in 2011 rendered the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance No. 45, 1970 void. “A fortiori, the Sedition Act 1948 as amended by the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance No. 45 1970 is no longer an exception to Izzah’s immunity. “Even if Izzah's speech has seditious tendency under any of the Sections 3(1)(a) to (g) of the Sedition Act, she cannot be liable to sedition,” New added. The last MP to be charged with sedition for parliamentary speech was Barisan Nasional MP Mark Koding in 1982, when he questioned the existence of Chinese and Tamil schools and the use of both languages on signboards. Koding was subsequently convicted for suggesting the amendment of Article 152 of the Federal Constitution, which pertains to the national language. “That’s the problem with the Sedition Act, everything can be seditious. It’s very difficult to say something is not seditious … That’s why we want it abolished,” added Syahredzan, whose Bar Council’s National Young Lawyers Committee is the organiser of the Abolish the Sedition Act campaign. Putrajaya previously pledged to repeal the Sedition Act 1948 that critics say is used to stifle political opposition and dissent, but later announced that it will be retained and expanded instead.", "labels": [[8, 18, "PERSON"], [28, 39, "ORG"], [44, 56, "PERSON"], [85, 95, "ORG"], [180, 185, "ORG"], [194, 202, "DATE"], [302, 312, "ORG"], [347, 368, "LAW"], [630, 646, "LOC"], [654, 666, "LAW"], [671, 695, "LAW"], [866, 887, "LAW"], [911, 923, "LAW"], [987, 992, "NORP"], [1051, 1061, "ORG"], [1174, 1190, "PERSON"], [1196, 1213, "ORG"], [1220, 1232, "LAW"], [1302, 1306, "DATE"], [1442, 1444, "ORG"], [1459, 1475, "LAW"], [1478, 1481, "ORG"], [1497, 1514, "PERSON"], [1528, 1537, "DATE"], [1563, 1573, "LOC"], [1655, 1674, "ORG"], [1722, 1746, "PERSON"], [1780, 1790, "ORG"], [1925, 1935, "PERSON"], [1945, 1956, "ORG"], [1961, 1973, "PERSON"], [2002, 2012, "ORG"], [2121, 2132, "PERSON"], [2188, 2200, "LAW"], [2272, 2293, "LAW"], [2355, 2363, "DATE"], [2378, 2381, "ORG"], [2463, 2477, "LAW"], [2482, 2498, "LAW"], [2605, 2610, "NORP"], [2747, 2754, "PERSON"], [2760, 2777, "ORG"], [2948, 2959, "ORG"], [2984, 2995, "ORG"], [2999, 3003, "DATE"], [3060, 3062, "CARDINAL"], [3064, 3068, "DATE"], [3088, 3109, "LAW"], [3171, 3178, "DATE"], [3208, 3215, "ORG"], [3235, 3240, "PERSON"], [3286, 3305, "FAC"], [3317, 3333, "LAW"], [3470, 3481, "PERSON"], [3485, 3489, "DATE"], [3527, 3534, "NORP"], [3539, 3544, "NORP"], [3664, 3703, "LAW"], [3771, 3787, "LAW"], [3914, 3924, "PERSON"], [3932, 3978, "ORG"], [4003, 4010, "NORP"], [4011, 4027, "LAW"], [4038, 4047, "ORG"], [4077, 4098, "LAW"]]}

Sepang district headquarters CID intelligence and operations officer Inspector Husny Hussein said her detention was notified by a Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (klia2) policeman who later brought Doan to the police station at the low-cost career terminal. “On Feb 15, 2017, I received information that a Vietnamese woman (Doan) who was believed to be involved in a murder case had been taken to the klia2 police station. After receiving the information, I went to klia2 with four personnel to arrest the woman. “I was told the woman was in an Uber car without the driver present when she was picked up by policemen there. They (klia2 policemen) took her to the station for questioning. “My personneI and I detained the woman and took her to the Sepang police headquarters,” he said when examined by deputy public prosecutor Muhamad Iskandar Ahmad. The 17th witness said as soon he had seen the woman, he found her to have the same image as a woman who attacked Jong-nam who was using the alias Kim Chol, as shown in a closed circuit television (CCTV) recording. “I saw the woman and made a comparison (to the images on the CCTV recording). She had the same face and body with the woman on CCTV. Then I proceeded to arrest her and seized a blue and white Dior bag and her shoes. After lodging a report, I handed her over to investigating officer ASP Wan Azirul Nizam Che Wan Aziz at 6pm,” he said. He was testifying in the trial of Indonesian national Siti Aisyah, 25, and Doan, 28, who were charged with four others still at large with the murder of Kim Chol, 45, at the departure hall of klia2 at 9am on Feb 13. When cross-examined by counsel Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, representing Doan, that his client did not attack Kim Chol until he was dead, the witness said he was not sure. Hisyam: Wasn’t what was done by Doan a prank’?. Husny: I do not know. Hisyam: I am saying Doan went to klia2 on Feb 15 to meet a Mr Y for the purpose of producing a prank video? Husny: Don’t know. The 18th witness, Sergeant Shamsul Bahrin Abdullah, 42, who is attached to the klia2 police station, said Kim Chol had with him money in various foreign currencies including 1,240 pieces of US$1,000 notes. He said on Feb 13, 2017, at 12.30pm, he was at the klia2 police station administration office when he received information from the complaints counter on a death case at Putrajaya Hospital. “I was informed that the victim was a man who died while on the way from klia2 to Putrajaya Hospital. I later went to the hospital’s Emergency Department. “Upon arrival, I was shown the body of the deceased on a stretcher covered with white cloth. I inspected randomly the deceased who had a plump body,” he said Shamsul Bahrin said he was shown a passport in the name of Kim Chol as well as the deceased’s personal effects by hospital staff. “I saw the hospital staff were examining the deceased’s items. I saw a pair of glasses, some foreign currencies, clothes, two mobile phones, a Nokia and an iPhone, a Dell laptop, rings and necklaces, medicines, shorts, denim pants , T-shirts, cap, underwear, socks, wallet, shaver, phone charger and perfume. “All the items were handed over to me and later kept in a metal safe at Sepang police district headquarters.

{"text": "Former Selangor menteri besar Dr Mohamad Khir Toyo arriving at the Federal Court Putrajaya, Sept. 22, 2015. PPUTRAJAYA, Sept 22 — Former Selangor mentri besar Dr Mohamad Khir Toyo pleaded with the Federal Court today to consider his role as the sole breadwinner of his young family before sentencing him in his corruption conviction. Speaking from the dock, the 50-year-old told the court that he has had to bear the shame of being charged over the past five years, and that he would have to find a new career to rebuild his family’s name after the ordeal. “I ask Yang Arif to consider because my children are still young and I am a role model to them… my wife doesn’t work,” said the licensed dentist and father of six. His lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah had earlier told the court that his client’s older children are aged 24, 16, 11 and that the latter also has twins aged 9 and another offspring that turns six tomorrow. Shafee had earlier also described Mohamad Khir as an “exemplary father” who personally tutored all six of his children in their school work in spite of his busy schedule as mentri besar. He said his client had also personally coached his children in reading the Islamic holy book, the Quran. Continuing his plea, Mohamad Khir also said: “When I look at my mother, I cry because I feel I have wronged my family, although I did it without any intention, without any intention at all.” The Umno man also recounted his contributions to Selangor during his tenure as Selangor mentri besar and insisted that no public funds were lost or involved in this case. “There was no public fund in this case. The state of Selangor did not suffer any losses,” he said. He said he had dedicated long hours daily while serving as mentri besar for eight years, and listed as his achievements the creation of 30,000 to 40,000 annual job opportunities, the resolution of squatter issues and how he had raised zakat collection from an initial RM40 million to RM250 million in 2008. In the same plea, he insisted that he had no intention to commit the offence and that he had no knowledge of the law as he was a dentist. He also said that only “Allah” knows the truth and what justice is. He did not speak to reporters after walking out of the packed courtroom. He will only know his fate next Tuesday afternoon, however, when the Federal Court panel returns with a decision on his sentencing. The offence of Section 165 of the Penal Code comes with a maximum two-year jail term or fine or both. Mohamad Khir lost his final appeal earlier today against a corruption conviction, but it is unknown for now if the Federal Court will maintain the one-year jail term handed down previously by a lower court. Earlier during the hearing, Federal Court judge Tan Sri Jeffrey Tan Kok Wha said that Mohamad Khir had taken full value of land and a house that was worth at least RM5 million, and that his payment of RM3.5 million was inadequate. “It remained that the offence as charged was proven beyond reasonable doubt,” the judge said when reading out a summary of a five-man panel’s unanimous decision.

{"text": "PKR's Chua Tian Chang says from day one, he has never said anything to defame anyone as well as to undermine national security. ― Picture by Yusof Mat Isa KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 ― PKR's Chua Tian Chang said today that he felt vindicated by the court’s decision to acquit him of sedition, and expressed hope this would put an end to claims that he had undermined national security. Chua also said he felt relieved and thankful that the Kuala Lumpur High Court decided this morning to uphold his previous acquittal over allegations that he had linked the “Umno government” to the 2013 Sulu intrusion of Lahad Datu, Sabah. “Of course I feel vindicated and that has been the position that I maintained from day one, that I have never said anything to defame anyone as well as to undermine national security,” the PKR vice-president told reporters immediately the Kuala Lumpur High Court's ruling in his favour. Chua said the controversy over his alleged remarks in a news report on the Lahad Datu incident had been “emotionally charged”, with no less than 500 police reports lodged against him. He added that at the time, there were large mobs that followed him to his events, with some attempting to assault him physically or using verbal threats against organisers of political ceramahs where he was present. Umno had also filed a civil suit against him over the incident but later withdrew it, he noted, claiming that it was likely because the party knew it had insufficient grounds to say that he had defamed it through the news report. “Today (with) the High Court's reaffirmation of decision of acquittal, I hope there will be no more wild accusations that I have undermined national security or insulted the security forces who have sacrificed their lives in the Lahad Datu intrusion,” he also said. Latheefa Koya, one of the lawyers who represented Chua, said the High Court judge had acted “fairly” in looking into the case's evidence and affirming the acquittal. “So we are glad to see justice done today. Nevertheless the fight against the draconian Act still continues, we still have many cases where the situation may differ and we still have to look into repealing the whole Sedition Act,” she told reporters. Earlier today, Kuala Lumpur High Court's Judicial commissioner Datuk Nordin Hassan rejected the prosecution's appeal against a 2014 acquittal of Chua, after finding no collaborating evidence to prove that the PKR leader had uttered the alleged seditious words. The judge said the prosecution's star witness Siti Nooraishah Geoffrey could not be the one supporting her own testimony, also pointing out that the then Keadilan Daily reporter's handwritten notes was not a verbatim record of her phone interview with Chua and was illegible. He highlighted Section 6(1) of the Sedition Act, which said that no person shall be convicted of a sedition offence on the uncorroborated testimony of one witness. On November 14, 2014, Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court judge Norsharidah Awang ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie case against Chua, and had said that he was discharged and there was no need to call him to enter his defence. Chua was charged on March 14, 2013 over his alleged remarks in an article titled “Insiden tembakan di Lahad Datu konspirasi terancang Umno ― Tian” (Shooting incident at Lahad Datu an orchestrated conspiracy by Umno ― Tian), which was published in Keadilan Daily on March 1 the same year. Among other things, the politician popularly known as Tian Chua allegedly said the Umno government had a conspiracy to divert the attention of Sabahans, particularly over the issuing of identity cards to foreigners. The penalty for first-time offenders under Section 4 (1) (b) of the Sedition Act 1948 is a maximum three-year jail term or a maximum fine of RM5,000 or both. A conviction could have caused Chua to lose his Batu parliamentary seat, as a fine of RM2,000 or a one-year jail term is enough to disqualify the 53-year-old as a member of Parliament.", "labels": [[0, 3, "ORG"], [6, 21, "ORG"], [32, 39, "DATE"], [141, 167, "PERSON"], [169, 176, "DATE"], [179, 182, "ORG"], [185, 200, "ORG"], [206, 211, "DATE"], [248, 250, "ORG"], [380, 384, "PERSON"], [430, 457, "ORG"], [466, 478, "TIME"], [577, 581, "DATE"], [600, 610, "GPE"], [612, 617, "GPE"], [702, 709, "DATE"], [808, 811, "ORG"], [854, 883, "ORG"], [906, 910, "PERSON"], [981, 991, "GPE"], [1051, 1054, "CARDINAL"], [1537, 1542, "DATE"], [1550, 1566, "ORG"], [1765, 1775, "GPE"], [1802, 1815, "PERSON"], [1817, 1820, "CARDINAL"], [1852, 1856, "PERSON"], [1867, 1877, "ORG"], [2004, 2009, "DATE"], [2184, 2196, "LAW"], [2219, 2232, "TIME"], [2234, 2259, "ORG"], [2260, 2268, "GPE"], [2282, 2301, "PERSON"], [2346, 2350, "CARDINAL"], [2364, 2368, "GPE"], [2428, 2431, "ORG"], [2526, 2550, "ORG"], [2634, 2648, "ORG"], [2732, 2736, "GPE"], [2771, 2782, "LAW"], [2787, 2803, "LAW"], [2923, 2940, "DATE"], [2942, 2969, "ORG"], [2976, 2993, "PERSON"], [3068, 3072, "ORG"], [3186, 3200, "DATE"], [3248, 3255, "GPE"], [3268, 3278, "GPE"], [3335, 3345, "PERSON"], [3376, 3387, "PERSON"], [3413, 3427, "ORG"], [3431, 3452, "DATE"], [3508, 3517, "ORG"], [3537, 3541, "PERSON"], [3597, 3605, "NORP"], [3686, 3691, "ORDINAL"], [3713, 3722, "LAW"], [3734, 3755, "LAW"], [3769, 3779, "DATE"], [3811, 3818, "PRODUCT"], [3859, 3863, "ORG"], [3876, 3880, "ORG"], [3914, 3921, "PRODUCT"], [3927, 3935, "DATE"], [4001, 4011, "ORG"]]}
{"text": "Datuk Zaid Ibrahim said although he may face a sedition charge for one of his writings, he will continue to speak out. — File pic KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 13 — Malaysians ought to speak out for the betterment of Malaysia and not be cowed by the authorities, as that is the only way to ensure that the country improves, a former law minister said today. In his latest blog post, Datuk Zaid Ibrahim said although he may face a sedition charge for one of his writings, he will continue speaking out as he believes that that is “the least” he could do. “If all we can do is write, then we must continue writing. If all we can do is speak, then we must speak out. “There is no better country than Malaysia and there is no better set of people—made up of various races professing different religions—than the people of this country. But the promise of who we can truly be will only be fulfilled if the people want things to be better,” he said. Zaid was relating details of a phone call he shared with his sister over his looming case, which was triggered by his criticism of the recent court decision in M. Indira Gandhi’s conversion-custody battle. The former Umno man said his sister had contacted him to express concern and even suggested that he stop blogging, but he said he dismissed the idea and refused to back down from his convictions. He maintained his opinion that he felt the judges in Indira’s case had been “heartless” and “unkind” and said he would not be cowed by any judge. Judges, he added, are meant to be the “last bastion of protection from tyranny” but they have instead lost their “capacity for compassion.” “So I told my sister, let’s not be cowed by these judges. They are like that because the people have given them too much latitude. They have rubbed shoulders with politicians and members of the royalty for far too long. “In the end, some of them have forgotten about little things such as kindness, compassion and the feelings of a mother,” he said. “Judges are the special individuals who can dispense justice when politicians and the other stakeholders in the system have failed altogether. “But when high-placed judges lose their capacity for compassion — in Indira’s case, to do what’s right and just for a mother — then we have a problem. The least we can do is to voice our concern,” he added. In 2009, Indira’s Muslim convert ex-spouse Muhammad Riduan Abdullah snatched away their youngest daughter Prasana Diksa then aged 11 months old, before unilaterally converting the three children in their absence. In the long drawn-out child custody battle, Indira subsequently won full custody of her three children in the Ipoh High Court on March 11, 2010, with the same civil court issuing a recovery order in her favour. On December 30 last year, the Court of Appeal reversed a lower court’s order quashing the unilateral conversion of Indira’s three children to Islam, a critical blow to the Hindu mother’s battle against her Muslim ex-spouse. Zaid subsequently wrote in his blog that the Hindu mother will not receive any justice from the Shariah courts, and labelled the judges “heartless” for the decision. He also called Malaysian judges “arrogant” and “hypersensitive” to criticism to the point of charging cartoonists and bloggers with sedition for merely expressing an opposing view. Yesterday, Zaid said that he expects to be charged with sedition after a police probe over his blog post criticising the judiciary over Indira’s interfaith custody case. Last year, Zaid was also questioned by police under the Sedition Act over his blog post, but was later charged under Section 233(1)(a) of the Communications and Multimedia Act for allegedly causing hurt with a blog post calling for Malaysians to rally behind former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad in calling for the current prime minister’s early resignation.", "labels": [[0, 18, "PERSON"], [67, 70, "CARDINAL"], [144, 150, "DATE"], [153, 163, "NORP"], [205, 213, "GPE"], [339, 344, "DATE"], [371, 389, "PERSON"], [438, 441, "CARDINAL"], [685, 693, "GPE"], [932, 936, "PERSON"], [1092, 1110, "PERSON"], [1149, 1153, "PRODUCT"], [1387, 1395, "ORG"], [2182, 2190, "ORG"], [2323, 2327, "DATE"], [2329, 2344, "PRODUCT"], [2363, 2387, "PERSON"], [2426, 2439, "PERSON"], [2450, 2463, "DATE"], [2500, 2505, "CARDINAL"], [2577, 2583, "ORG"], [2621, 2626, "CARDINAL"], [2639, 2658, "ORG"], [2662, 2676, "DATE"], [2747, 2768, "DATE"], [2770, 2789, "ORG"], [2812, 2814, "ORG"], [2859, 2865, "ORG"], [2868, 2873, "CARDINAL"], [2886, 2891, "ORG"], [2916, 2921, "NORP"], [2950, 2956, "NORP"], [2968, 2972, "PERSON"], [3013, 3018, "NORP"], [3064, 3071, "GPE"], [3149, 3158, "NORP"], [3315, 3324, "DATE"], [3326, 3330, "PERSON"], [3451, 3459, "ORG"], [3485, 3494, "DATE"], [3496, 3500, "PERSON"], [3537, 3553, "LAW"], [3602, 3618, "LAW"], [3627, 3641, "NORP"], [3646, 3660, "PERSON"], [3717, 3727, "NORP"], [3766, 3772, "PERSON"], [3773, 3789, "PERSON"]]}
{"text": "PKR’s Chua Tian Chang was charged on March 14, 2013 for his alleged remarks in an article published in Keadilan Daily on March 1 last year. ― Picture by Choo Choy May KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 ― PKR leader Chua Tian Chang was acquitted today for the second time in a sedition case against him for allegedly linking the “Umno government” to the 2013 Sulu intrusion of Lahad Datu, Sabah. The Kuala Lumpur High Court's Judicial commissioner Datuk Nordin Hassan rejected the prosecution's appeal against a 2014 acquittal of Chua, after having found that there was no collaborating evidence to prove that the PKR vice-president had indeed uttered the alleged seditious words. “Appeal of prosecution in this case is dismissed. The acquittal is maintained,” the judge said. During the appeal hearing earlier, the judge said the only issue to be considered was whether there was evidence to support the sedition charge against Chua, also reminding the prosecution that it needs to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Deputy public prosecutor Julia Ibrahim said the prosecution was relying on its third and final witness ― then Keadilan Daily reporter Siti Nooraishah Geoffrey ― as well as her written notes from a phone interview with Chua. Julia said the handwritten notes were not a verbatim record of Chua's words and had contained keywords of the conversation, but stressed that Siti Nooraishah had after ending the conversation immediately typed it out while it was still “fresh in her mind”. The judge said the prosecution's star witness could not be the one supporting her own testimony, also pointing out that the reporter's handwritten notes were illegible and could not be read by Siti Nooraishah herself. “But P4 (the handwritten notes) cannot be understood. Even SP3 (Siti Nooraishah) doesn't know what it said, so the other contemporaneous evidence is the typed document. “If P4 is verbatim and the court can understand, it can be collaborating evidence,” the judge said, also observing that the prosecution had not presented the typed draft as evidence in court during the trial. The judge also pointed out that even if the court accepted that the prosecution's star witness was a credible witness, Parliament had intended for the sedition cases to require collaborating evidence. He highlighted Section 6(1) of the Sedition Act, which said that no person shall be convicted of a sedition offence on the uncorroborated testimony of one witness. On November 14, 2014, Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court judge Norsharidah Awang ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie case against Chua, and had said that he was discharged and there was no need to call him to enter his defence. Among other things, Norsharidah had noted the complainant Johor Bahru Umno Youth's vice chief Syed Amirruddin Syed Jaffar could not say that Chua had made the four alleged seditious remarks. The Sessions Court judge had also noted that Siti Nooraishah had testified that she had not taken verbatim notes of her phone conversation with Chua, with the most important point being the former reporter's admission that she had not taken down the four alleged remarks word-for-word in her notes and they were written based on her own understanding. Norsharidah had concluded that the statements made could be “manipulated”, added on and written by the reporter based on her own understanding. Chua was charged on March 14, 2013 for his alleged remarks in an article titled “Insiden tembakan di Lahad Datu konspirasi terancang Umno ― Tian” (Shooting incident at Lahad Datu an orchestrated conspiracy by Umno ― Tian), which was published in Keadilan Daily on March 1 the same year.

{"text": "File photo of 'balloon girl’ Bilqis Hijjas at the Majistrate Court on September 23, 2015. ― Picture by Yusof Mat Isa KUALA LUMPUR, May 13 — The organiser of an arts festival was “angry” and disappointed that the event attended by the prime minister last year was hijacked by the throwing of yellow balloons, the Magistrates’ Court heard today. Event organiser Sunita Mei-lin Rajakumar, 47, said she was “angry” because the incident diverted public and media attention away from the city’s first Kuala Lumpur International Arts Festival which Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak attended. “The effect was quite bad because many were talking about the incident and not the festival,” she told deputy public prosecutor Mohamad Fadhly Mohd Zamry, adding that the first media reports were on the balloon-throwing incident instead of the event. Sunita was testifying at the trial of Bilqis Hijjas, who was charged with “insulting behaviour” under the Minor Offences Act 1955 for allegedly dropping several yellow balloons from the fifth floor of the Pavilion shopping centre here to the second floor, where the festival’s opening ceremony was held. Sunita explained that Kuala Lumpur had never had a large-scale festival of this nature, unlike other capital cities in the South-east Asian region. “I feel disappointed because I consider this festival as an important festival in the capital city’s history. Because if it is to succeed, then arts practitioners have to cooperate to ensure this festival is not hijacked for other purposes,” said Sunita, who is both the festival director and the director of the festival’s organiser Surprise Voice Sdn Bhd. She later also said it would have been “irritating and disrespectful” if anybody had tried to hijack the August 31 event, which was meant to show the organiser’s appreciation to the government for its arts grant for the festival. But she confirmed that she did not lodge a complaint on the incident, also saying that she was “not aware” if the prime minister and his wife had lodged a complaint. Sunita also said the entire event attended by the prime minister proceeded as scheduled despite the throwing of the yellow balloons, confirming that a five-minute video presentation at 3.15pm was not interrupted when the balloons allegedly fell. Sunita said she had initially not known nor seen the balloon-throwing incident when it happened, but was later told about it. When questioned about the balloons that had fallen behind a LCD screen, she said those seated in front of the screen measuring 20 by 30 feet may not have noticed them. She noted, however, that several visitors seated at the back had spotted the balloons falling down and taken pictures of it, saying: “I don’t think anybody I spoke to took it for entertainment.” The festival was carried out for five weeks in various spots throughout the city and had also featured arts practitioners from other countries, she said. Abd Razal Salleh, 37, an auxiliary police personnel who worked in Pavilion’s control room, testified that the recordings of the mall’s security cameras cannot be edited. He said that he had copied the video recordings of the mall’s close-circuit televisions relating to the balloon-throwing incident into CDs for use in this case, adding that it was another co-worker who had selected the relevant clips. The hearing before magistrate Muhamad Faizal Ismail resumes on June 2, with two more witnesses expected to be called in by the prosecution. Charged under Section 14 of the Minor Offences Act 1955 last September 23, Bilqis faces a maximum RM100 fine over alleged “insulting behaviour” with the purported purpose of inciting anger that may cause a disturbance of peace. In the incident last August 31 at 3.15pm at Pavilion, several yellow balloons printed with the words “Free media”, “Democracy” and “Justice” were said to have been released. During the trial, several of the prosecution’s witnesses had associated the yellow colour of the balloons to the two-day Bersih 4 rally by polls reform group Bersih 2.0, where protesters had sought the prime minister’s removal.", "labels": [[29, 42, "PERSON"], [46, 66, "ORG"], [70, 88, "DATE"], [103, 129, "PERSON"], [131, 137, "DATE"], [249, 258, "DATE"], [312, 330, "ORG"], [337, 342, "DATE"], [360, 374, "PERSON"], [375, 384, "GPE"], [386, 388, "DATE"], [486, 535, "ORG"], [557, 579, "PERSON"], [718, 732, "PERSON"], [733, 743, "PERSON"], [841, 847, "PERSON"], [879, 892, "PERSON"], [943, 970, "LAW"], [1027, 1032, "ORDINAL"], [1046, 1054, "ORG"], [1083, 1089, "ORDINAL"], [1145, 1151, "PERSON"], [1167, 1179, "GPE"], [1268, 1273, "LOC"], [1279, 1284, "NORP"], [1540, 1546, "PERSON"], [1614, 1616, "ORG"], [1642, 1649, "PERSON"], [1756, 1765, "DATE"], [2047, 2053, "ORG"], [2198, 2209, "TIME"], [2232, 2238, "CARDINAL"], [2293, 2299, "PERSON"], [2546, 2559, "QUANTITY"], [2815, 2825, "DATE"], [2936, 2952, "PERSON"], [2954, 2956, "DATE"], [3002, 3012, "ORG"], [3371, 3392, "PERSON"], [3404, 3410, "DATE"], [3417, 3420, "CARDINAL"], [3495, 3505, "LAW"], [3509, 3531, "LAW"], [3532, 3554, "DATE"], [3556, 3562, "NORP"], [3579, 3584, "ORG"], [3725, 3739, "DATE"], [3743, 3749, "CARDINAL"], [3753, 3761, "ORG"], [3841, 3848, "ORG"], [3927, 3929, "ORG"], [3996, 4003, "DATE"], [4004, 4012, "DATE"], [4041, 4051, "ORG"]]}
{"text": "GEORGE TOWN: It’s a case of much ado over three durians, so much so that enforcement officers have to step in to investigate. The thorny issue began when a woman voiced her displeasure about paying almost RM1,000 for the durians – two Black Thorn and one Musang King. Her post about the shop, located along Macalister Road, went viral. The shop owner, Chin Ah Chian, 52, was equally unhappy as the online post led to negative comments hurled at him. He said the woman had come to his shop, asking for “the biggest fruits and the tastiest ones”. (Apparently, she was there with a group of people and they consumed the durians at the shop.) “The Black Thorn that day cost RM95 per kg, but we charged her RM90 per kg, while the Musang King was RM60 then.” “My staff had told her how much the durians would cost per kg,” said Ah Chian, who was not present when the woman came to his shop last Thursday. When it was time to pay, Ah Chian said the woman apparently remarked that it was expensive but did not make a fuss about it and paid RM937. “If she did have a problem, she could have asked to speak to me or called my number, which is on a banner above our rack of durians.” Ah Chian said he was giving the woman a week’s time to see him and talk it over. Otherwise, he said he would lodge a police report against her. “Her post has given my shop some extra attention but it is hurtful to read the comments.” He said that he was not charging any much more than other sellers. “There is a daily price for the durians; it differs each day. The season is just starting, so the fruits are pricier.” On the investigation by the Penang branch of the Domestic Trade, Coopera­tives and Consumerism Ministry, Ah Chian said he would fully cooperate with them as he wanted to prove that he was not in the wrong. “I have nothing to hide and will provide them with all the required information to clear my shop’s name,” he added. As for the woman, she said she was not worried if the shop owner went ahead with the police report. “I am not the one at fault,” she said yesterday. She said the workers did not tell her from the start about the weight of the durians until it was time to pay up. The woman also said she was now overseas and had asked her friends who were with her during the incident to meet the shop owner. Penang branch of the Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism Ministry enforcement chief Chin Ching Chung said an investigation was being carried out under the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act . “Our officers visited the shop and checked their pricing and weighing scale to see if it is calibrated. “We have now asked them to provide us with proof of the cost of their supply, the rental of the shop, their profit margin and other costs like salary for their staff. “We have given them till June 18 to provide the documentation. After they respond, we will calculate to see their profit margin and whether it is above what is stipulated under the regulations,” he said. “It should take us about a month to find out if he is overcharging. “If we do find that there is profiteering, we will either issue him a compound, which could go up to RM100,000, or he could be charged in court under Section 14(1) of the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act. “So far, the owner of the durian shop has been cooperating with us,” he added. He said the officers also advised him to put up better signs to indicate the price per kilo. Going by regulations, Ching Chung said they would usually require three years of data from the seller to compare the pricing, but this shop has only been operating for the past six months.", "labels": [[42, 47, "CARDINAL"], [198, 212, "CARDINAL"], [231, 234, "CARDINAL"], [235, 246, "LOC"], [251, 254, "CARDINAL"], [307, 322, "FAC"], [352, 365, "PERSON"], [367, 369, "DATE"], [640, 655, "ORG"], [656, 664, "DATE"], [721, 736, "FAC"], [822, 830, "PERSON"], [884, 897, "DATE"], [924, 932, "ORG"], [1032, 1037, "PRODUCT"], [1213, 1217, "DATE"], [1486, 1491, "DATE"], [1526, 1534, "DATE"], [1621, 1627, "GPE"], [1638, 1656, "ORG"], [1658, 1675, "ORG"], [1676, 1696, "ORG"], [1698, 1706, "ORG"], [2053, 2062, "DATE"], [2307, 2313, "GPE"], [2324, 2342, "ORG"], [2344, 2356, "ORG"], [2361, 2381, "ORG"], [2400, 2416, "PERSON"], [2467, 2484, "ORG"], [2489, 2510, "LAW"], [2809, 2816, "DATE"], [3007, 3020, "DATE"], [3206, 3218, "LAW"], [3223, 3240, "ORG"], [3245, 3266, "LAW"], [3462, 3473, "ORG"], [3506, 3517, "DATE"], [3608, 3627, "DATE"]]}

Ooi Previous Next Today’s result marks the second time that Wan Azizah, 62, has stepped in for her husband during his controversial imprisonments. She won the same seat in 1999, replacing Anwar after he was sacked as deputy prime minister in Malaysia’s long-ruling government and jailed on previous sodomy and corruption charges widely considered politically motivated. That imprisonment left Wan Azizah at the head of the reform movement that emerged in response to Anwar’s ouster, and she twice defended the seat. But she vacated it in 2008 to allow the charismatic Anwar to return to parliament after his release. Taking over leadership of the opposition, he helped inspire a once-fragmented opposition to unprecedented gains in parliament, nearly taking power in 2013 polls from the ruling coalition that has dominated Malaysia for decades. The widely respected Wan Azizah, a petite woman who wears a traditional Muslim headscarf, appears unlikely to replace her husband as opposition leader, however. That baton is expected to pass to Anwar’s longtime protégé Azmin Ali. There had been some concern over Wan Azizah’s ability to retain the seat for her People’s Justice Party. The three-party opposition alliance is mired in uncertainty amid internal policy squabbling, a situation worsened now without Anwar’s dominant presence. In particular, the conservative PAS, part of the opposition alliance, has angered many moderates by calling for harsh Shariah law in a state it governs, despite an earlier pledge not to. The Shariah campaign looks unlikely to succeed. But Wan Azizah prevailed with a comfortable win, according to the unofficial results cited by Malaysian media. There was no immediate statement from her. The sodomy conviction for Anwar, now 67, threatens to end his political career. He calls the case a conspiracy by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s government to derail the opposition’s momentum. Najib has been condemned at home and abroad over the Anwar case and for the arrests of scores of opposition politicians and other critics over the past year on sedition and other charges. — AFP",

Families of Chinese passengers on the MH370 flight had yesterday demanded for an apology from Malaysia for allegedly releasing contradicting information earlier on and declaring that the flight had ended in the Indian Ocean without giving “concrete evidence”. When asked to clear the apparent confusion where the Malaysian prime minister said the plane was assumed to have been “ended” while others consider it as a “crash”, Hishammuddin said that everyone should refer to the official statement issued by the Malaysian government. “I stress that I never announced that there are no victims who did not survive,” he said when replying claims that there are no survivors of flight MH370, also directing attention to the government’s official statement. Noting that various international news agencies such as CNN, BBC and Al-Jazeera frequently make statements on the MH370 search, Hishammuddin said: “But iIf you want accurate information, I suggest you hold to the official statement that we issued. That was issued by me and also Datuk Seri Najib Razak.” Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein listens during a news conference about the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport March 16, 2014. — Reuters pic He also singled out CNN, saying that the US news channel had acted “unfairly” towards Malaysia, but said their allegedly “irresponsible” behaviour would ultimately cause their credibility to be questioned. Hishammuddin said that Malaysia would one day disclose all the news agencies that had spread false information. “Whoever that spreads false information and make baseless speculations, we will reveal. Not now, because now we give our main focus to the MH370 search, but we will reveal to the public one day,” he said in the interview. Hishammuddin said no charges have been imposed on Malaysia for all the aid offered by the 26 countries and the satellite firm in the MH370 search. “So far, all of it is free. This is what I am confused about because there is no one who raised the issue of finances because it would necessarily involve a huge cost,” he said, but did not directly reply a question on whether charges would be imposed later. The multinational search for the plane and the 239 people on board is now in its fourth week.", "labels": [[0, 12, "ORG"], [14, 22, "DATE"], [25, 33, "GPE"], [82, 99, "ORG"], [101, 104, "ORG"], [113, 118, "ORG"], [177, 208, "PERSON"], [219, 231, "PERSON"], [254, 262, "GPE"], [355, 362, "DATE"], [469, 474, "ORG"], [560, 565, "DATE"], [566, 578, "ORG"], [581, 589, "GPE"], [662, 670, "GPE"], [752, 763, "PERSON"], [764, 795, "PERSON"], [810, 825, "ORG"], [831, 843, "ORG"], [879, 906, "EVENT"], [933, 953, "PERSON"], [997, 1002, "NORP"], [1006, 1018, "GPE"], [1019, 1033, "DATE"], [1091, 1124, "ORG"], [1152, 1157, "GPE"], [1161, 1173, "GPE"], [1174, 1188, "DATE"], [1263, 1268, "NORP"], [1277, 1295, "ORG"], [1311, 1320, "PRODUCT"], [1324, 1339, "GPE"], [1340, 1354, "DATE"], [1412, 1417, "NORP"], [1445, 1455, "ORG"], [1459, 1466, "GPE"], [1467, 1481, "DATE"], [1499, 1506, "NORP"], [1547, 1552, "PRODUCT"], [1604, 1626, "FAC"], [1637, 1645, "GPE"], [1651, 1665, "DATE"], [1667, 1676, "ORG"], [1683, 1690, "NORP"], [1731, 1736, "PRODUCT"], [1760, 1769, "PERSON"], [1789, 1797, "NORP"], [1808, 1816, "GPE"], [1822, 1836, "DATE"], [1838, 1847, "ORG"], [1920, 1937, "ORG"], [1962, 1971, "NORP"], [1975, 1985, "WORK_OF_ART"], [1989, 2017, "ORG"], [2026, 2038, "GPE"], [2040, 2054, "DATE"], [2056, 2081, "ORG"], [2097, 2108, "PERSON"], [2110, 2113, "ORDINAL"], [2149, 2166, "ORG"], [2183, 2215, "ORG"], [2226, 2236, "PERSON"], [2250, 2255, "GPE"], [2272, 2297, "ORG"], [2313, 2324, "PERSON"], [2344, 2357, "GPE"], [2358, 2362, "ORG"], [2371, 2384, "PERSON"], [2405, 2421, "ORG"], [2427, 2432, "GPE"], [2433, 2447, "DATE"], [2449, 2474, "ORG"], [2490, 2501, "PERSON"], [2521, 2558, "ORG"], [2571, 2580, "GPE"], [2583, 2598, "ORG"], [2609, 2619, "PERSON"], [2621, 2624, "ORDINAL"], [2636, 2641, "GPE"], [2658, 2667, "ORG"], [2672, 2682, "NORP"], [2698, 2709, "PERSON"], [2727, 2735, "GPE"], [2738, 2747, "ORG"], [2775, 2791, "ORG"], [2797, 2802, "GPE"], [2803, 2817, "DATE"], [2819, 2828, "ORG"], [2889, 2901, "GPE"], [2903, 2917, "DATE"], [2919, 2928, "ORG"], [3013, 3025, "GPE"], [3027, 3041, "DATE"], [3114, 3126, "GPE"], [3128, 3142, "DATE"], [3144, 3171, "ORG"], [3377, 3384, "NORP"], [3403, 3408, "ORG"], [3420, 3429, "DATE"], [3459, 3467, "GPE"], [3572, 3588, "LOC"], [3678, 3687, "NORP"], [3790, 3802, "PERSON"], [3875, 3884, "NORP"], [4045, 4050, "ORG"], [4094, 4096, "ORG"], [4173, 4176, "ORG"], [4178, 4181, "ORG"], [4186, 4196, "ORG"], [4231, 4236, "NORP"], [4245, 4257, "PERSON"], [4396, 4418, "PERSON"], [4421, 4429, "GPE"], [4458, 4489, "PERSON"], [4541, 4558, "ORG"], [4566, 4571, "ORG"], [4576, 4616, "FAC"], [4661, 4664, "ORG"], [4682, 4684, "GPE"], [4727, 4735, "GPE"], [4847, 4859, "PERSON"], [4870, 4878, "GPE"], [4885, 4892, "DATE"], [5098, 5103, "ORG"], [5145, 5152, "DATE"], [5181, 5193, "PERSON"], [5231, 5239, "GPE"], [5271, 5273, "CARDINAL"], [5314, 5319, "ORG"], [5636, 5639, "CARDINAL"], [5666, 5681, "DATE"]]}
{"text": "Regional General Manager of Uber Technologies in Southeast Asia Michael Brown poses at the launch of the UberX range, on August 6, 2014. - Picture by Saw Siow Feng KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 28 — Residents of KL, as well those who have used Uber, are now up in arms after false reports surfaced saying that the popular smartphone car-hailing app was declared illegal. A front-page report in an English language daily today said that the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) has banned Uber highlighting the fact that it was illegal to use private as well as Hire and Drive cars. SPAD chief Tan Sri Syed Hamid Albar however said it was “open to allowing this service, as long as the services are provided by appropriately licensed vehicles and drivers.” “Under the current regulatory scheme, among the vehicles used by UBER, only licensed limousines are eligible to offer chauffeur-driven services and since there are 839 licensed limousines nationwide which are eligible to offer this service, the supply of vehicles and drivers should therefore not be an issue for UBER,” he said in a statement yesterday. The same statement was used as the basis of the front-page report which erroneously reported that it has been declared illegal. Uber users took to social media to slam the regulatory body for purportedly banning the service and seemed to favour taxis which they claimed are not up to par. “I am saddened to hear that Uber is banned in Malaysia. I get stressed taking taxis because of high prices and scared for my safety too,” Sara de Souza ‏@saradesouza wrote on her Twitter account. Soefira ‏@soefira and Michael Yip ‏@zique shared the sentiments of many others on taxi services which they said need to “buck up”, if they want to thrive. “Totally pissed at SPAD’s knee-jerk reaction to Uber. If you say that their cars are not inspected by PUSPAKOM, can you also please send every taxi for inspection? “The last taxi I took was from LCCT to Ampang at midnight and number one, driver nearly fell asleep. Number two, his fricking alignment was damn off (I’m OCD like that) cause the car kept swerving to left and almost hit a biker, twice!”, Jeff Sandhu posted on his Facebook account. He added that he had not been in a regular taxi since the incident and would gladly pay more for Uber. Local singer Dasha Logan also showed her support for Uber on her Facebook page. “I don’t know how many times I’ve been left alone because a taxi I had booked couldn’t wait 5 minutes for me to come down from my apartment. “Uber waits, uber drivers put on their seat belts and uber doesn’t try to rip me off. ‪#‎uber also makes me look damn good,” she wrote. JJ Red fm ‏@JJ_on_air wrote, “Well @Uber_KL provided me security, reliability, comfort & fairness. And that’s wrong?” Denesh Dmaniac said he depends on Uber after being out drinking. “Please don’t shut Uber down... I always UBER to clubs and now if its shut down i’m forced to drive home when i’m drunk simply because i don’t have the confidence in our local taxi companies. “I preferred UBER it’s because it’s comfortable and the main reason would be SAFETY,” he posted on his Facebook page. He also said he feels safer that his girlfriend uses Uber to meetings compared to taking taxis as he would be able to track the car and make sure she arrived at her destination safely. Also on Facebook, Chee Ching said she prefers Uber because it offers pick-up at “inconvenient places”. “NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I always prefer Uber over taxis anytime. Nobody fetches me at inconvenient places but Uber does. Only in Malaysia, official bodies declare competitors illegal when they cannot catch up”. Looi Zuan Heng who had initially said he didn’t need Uber’s services as he has a car, recently tried it and said he liked it a lot as the service provided was professional, the car was clean, the driver well-mannered and did not overcharge, and he felt safe. Meanwhile, the Association for the Improvement of Mass Transit, Transit Malaysia also showed their support and posted on their Facebook page saying Uber is providing services that some taxi drivers failed to provide. “Taxi drivers need to understand that @uber is not taking their passengers... it is giving those passengers a level of service & choice that some taxi drivers do not to provide. “Some drivers have been able to get away with this for years because of poor planning, lax regulation & enforcement. That’s why#uber (and @myteksi & @myEasyTaxi) are shaking things up so easily... because this is what the market wants”. Whatever Uber chooses to do next, it is definitely basking in the attention it got over the “banned” report today and enjoying the overwhelming support it got from its fans. Uber was launched in the Klang Valley late last year with its UberBlack product which offers cars such as Toyota Camry, Toyota Alphard, Mercedes E class, starts at RM3, the same as budget taxis. But for every kilometre, Uber charges RM1.15 while taxis, RM0.87. And for every minute, Uber charges an additional RM0.35 while for taxis, it is RM0.10 for every 21 seconds. At certain times, mostly on weekend nights when the demand is high, there is also the UberLux range of cars with a higher base fare of RM10 and a minimum fare of RM30. Two weeks ago, Uber launched its lower range product under UberX in the Klang Valley, which is 15 per cent lower than the budget taxi fares. Uber also started offering its services in Johor Baru two days ago and according to some of the drivers here, there are plans to expand to Penang as well.", "labels": [[28, 45, "ORG"], [49, 63, "LOC"], [64, 77, "PERSON"], [121, 135, "DATE"], [154, 176, "PERSON"], [182, 184, "CARDINAL"], [232, 236, "GPE"], [385, 392, "LANGUAGE"], [424, 460, "ORG"], [462, 466, "ORG"], [479, 483, "PERSON"], [552, 556, "PERSON"], [561, 566, "PERSON"], [584, 591, "PERSON"], [592, 608, "PERSON"], [812, 816, "ORG"], [911, 914, "CARDINAL"], [1060, 1064, "ORG"], [1090, 1099, "DATE"], [1418, 1422, "PERSON"], [1436, 1444, "GPE"], [1528, 1541, "PERSON"], [1608, 1627, "PERSON"], [1789, 1793, "GPE"], [1954, 1962, "TIME"], [1974, 1977, "CARDINAL"], [2013, 2016, "CARDINAL"], [2143, 2154, "PERSON"], [2169, 2177, "PERSON"], [2284, 2288, "PERSON"], [2303, 2314, "PERSON"], [2343, 2347, "PERSON"], [2355, 2363, "PERSON"], [2462, 2471, "TIME"], [2512, 2516, "PERSON"], [2647, 2653, "ORG"], [2799, 2803, "GPE"], [2849, 2853, "PERSON"], [2871, 2875, "ORG"], [3035, 3039, "ORG"], [3099, 3105, "ORG"], [3125, 3133, "PERSON"], [3193, 3197, "PERSON"], [3333, 3341, "PERSON"], [3343, 3353, "PERSON"], [3371, 3375, "PERSON"], [3485, 3489, "PERSON"], [3555, 3559, "PERSON"], [3574, 3582, "GPE"], [3656, 3670, "PERSON"], [3709, 3715, "ORG"], [3926, 3977, "ORG"], [4063, 4067, "PERSON"], [4170, 4175, "PERSON"], [4365, 4370, "DATE"], [4448, 4470, "ORG"], [4556, 4560, "PERSON"], [4655, 4660, "DATE"], [4721, 4725, "PERSON"], [4742, 4758, "LOC"], [4759, 4773, "DATE"], [4783, 4792, "ORG"], [4827, 4833, "ORG"], [4834, 4839, "PRODUCT"], [4841, 4847, "ORG"], [4848, 4855, "PRODUCT"], [4857, 4865, "ORG"], [4941, 4945, "PERSON"], [4990, 5002, "TIME"], [5004, 5008, "PERSON"], [5031, 5037, "PERSON"], [5072, 5088, "TIME"], [5118, 5132, "DATE"], [5176, 5183, "ORG"], [5258, 5271, "DATE"], [5273, 5277, "PERSON"], [5317, 5322, "ORG"], [5326, 5342, "LOC"], [5353, 5364, "MONEY"], [5399, 5403, "PERSON"], [5442, 5452, "GPE"], [5453, 5465, "DATE"], [5538, 5544, "GPE"]]}
{"text": "A motorist inserts money into an automated parking fees machine at Jalan Kenanga, Kuala Lumpur, July 18, 2016. DBKL has hiked parking rates to RM2 for the first hour and RM3 for the second hour with a maximum two-hour parking limit. — Picture by Choo Choy May KUALA LUMPUR, July 18 — A public transport advocacy group has lauded the Kuala Lumpur City Hall’s (DBKL) unpopular decision to sharply increase parking rates here, but said more drastic measures were needed to address public apathy towards worsening congestion. Ajit Johl, president of the National Public Transport Users, said the parking tariff increase could be the first step in the long and intricate fight to reduce traffic congestion within KL, but suggested that DBKL and Putrajaya make it much more expensive for car owners to enter the city. “It is definitely a move in the right direction. (Private) cars are causing the congestion (and they) are giving a problem not only to the average person but also to public transport because taxis and buses use road. So any move to cut congestion is welcomed,” Ajit told Malay Mail Online through a phone interview. “The government is spending billions on public transport infrastructures so we should encourage the people to use public transport in fact, the tariff should be further increased because a car is not a necessity, it is a luxury,” he added. Calls to lower dependency on private vehicles to transit within the city is not new. The government has spent billions of ringgit trying to shift Malaysians’ feet from car accelerators onto the pavement in a bid to cut traffic. Two Light Rail Transit (LRT) lines have been built, with one recently extended as far as Putra Heights near Puchong, about 20 km outside the city. Billions were also spent on improving buses and taxi services, and millions more on awareness campaigns like the now-failed carpooling policy introduced under the Mahathir era. And less than five years ago Putrajaya embarked on the country’s biggest public transportation infrastructure project in her history — the 214km Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system that is costing taxpayers close RM30 billion. Public transport “low class” Bar the MRT, which is due for completion in 2021, they have all failed to increase public transport usage and cut congestion. Although not rated formally, KL was listed as among the most densely congested cities in the world next to more populated places like Munich and Hong Kong, according to Cities and Automobile Dependency: A Notebook. And this was in 1999. Ajit said the truth is the mindset of the average Malaysian is already too complacent. Despite marked improvement in the city’s public transportation system, Malaysian city-dwellers still view using the LRT or buses as “low class”. “There are more than 2.4 million public transport users in KL. So it surely can’t be that bad,” he said when suggested that the most popular reason for not hopping onto the train or buses was their unreliability. “Of course there is room for improvement but public transportation has progressed tremendously from the days of the BMW or Bus Mini Wilayah (old tiny 20-seater bus crammed by up to 50 people in one go)... but people still view public transportation as those for the lower and lower middle class,” he said. But punctuality is a valid concern for those relying on public transport. Complaints are rife, especially over bus drivers who, according to users, are rarely on time. However, Ajit argued that many of the complaints against buses should be directed at traffic congestion itself. Traffic jams mean delayed arrivals. Delayed arrivals mean frustrated and complaining passengers. This prompts people to buy more private vehicles, which then goes back to square one — worst congestion. “Less congestion means easier transit for the buses and taxis. Which makes them more efficient,” he said. 50,000 new cars monthly DBKL’s move to increase parking tariffs follows closely policies of cities like London and Singapore, which have made it prohibitively expensive not only to drive around town, but to own a car, as part of their campaign to reduce traffic congestion, and inculcate a culture that views reliance on public transports as one’s civic duty to his/her city and the environment. In London, motorists are hit with “congestion charges” of up to GBP11.50 (RM60) daily while Singapore went one step further by making motorists buy a certificate of entitlement before they are allowed to purchase cars. Ajit said the same should be done in Malaysia, noting that Malaysians have become spoilt as owning cars was as easy as buying instant noodles. But this must coincide with better accessibility to better facilities to encourage public transport usage like bigger parking areas for LRT users. He also suggested that some mechanism be developed to make it cheaper for those who rely heavily on private vehicles for their jobs, and that tariffs and congestion charges should be targeted towards stationary city workers. DBKL noted that KL registers more than 50,000 new vehicles monthly. Ajit also suggested that cars entering KL on Fridays be taxed instead of the current proposal to charge vehicles entering the cities on Sundays. Friday traffic in the city is likely the worst in a week, especially after salary day. But Ajit cautioned that increasing parking tariffs and road taxes alone will not suffice to change the mindset of Malaysians, noting that it must be introduced alongside awareness campaigns. “Have more high profile people use public transports. Look at the Mayor of London, even he uses public transport. This could encourage people to cut dependency on private vehicles”.", "labels": [[67, 80, "ORG"], [82, 94, "GPE"], [96, 109, "DATE"], [111, 115, "ORG"], [143, 146, "PERSON"], [151, 165, "TIME"], [178, 193, "TIME"], [209, 217, "TIME"], [246, 255, "PERSON"], [274, 281, "DATE"], [329, 357, "ORG"], [522, 531, "PERSON"], [546, 581, "ORG"], [629, 634, "ORDINAL"], [708, 710, "ORG"], [731, 735, "GPE"], [740, 749, "ORG"], [1083, 1100, "ORG"], [1156, 1164, "CARDINAL"], [1478, 1486, "CARDINAL"], [1514, 1524, "NORP"], [1596, 1599, "CARDINAL"], [1600, 1618, "ORG"], [1620, 1623, "ORG"], [1653, 1656, "CARDINAL"], [1685, 1698, "GPE"], [1704, 1711, "GPE"], [1713, 1724, "QUANTITY"], [1810, 1818, "CARDINAL"], [1906, 1914, "PERSON"], [1924, 1948, "DATE"], [1949, 1958, "PERSON"], [2059, 2064, "QUANTITY"], [2065, 2083, "ORG"], [2085, 2088, "ORG"], [2170, 2183, "WORK_OF_ART"], [2216, 2220, "DATE"], [2327, 2329, "ORG"], [2432, 2438, "GPE"], [2443, 2452, "GPE"], [2467, 2511, "ORG"], [2529, 2533, "DATE"], [2535, 2539, "ORG"], [2585, 2594, "NORP"], [2693, 2702, "NORP"], [2738, 2741, "ORG"], [2778, 2799, "CARDINAL"], [2826, 2828, "GPE"], [3096, 3099, "ORG"], [3103, 3119, "PERSON"], [3155, 3163, "CARDINAL"], [3463, 3467, "ORG"], [3744, 3747, "CARDINAL"], [3874, 3880, "CARDINAL"], [3890, 3897, "DATE"], [3898, 3904, "ORG"], [3978, 3984, "GPE"], [3989, 3998, "GPE"], [4216, 4219, "CARDINAL"], [4273, 4279, "GPE"], [4334, 4342, "PERSON"], [4362, 4371, "GPE"], [4377, 4380, "CARDINAL"], [4489, 4493, "ORG"], [4526, 4534, "GPE"], [4548, 4558, "NORP"], [4768, 4771, "ORG"], [5004, 5008, "PERSON"], [5020, 5022, "ORG"], [5033, 5049, "CARDINAL"], [5063, 5070, "DATE"], [5111, 5113, "ORG"], [5117, 5124, "DATE"], [5208, 5215, "DATE"], [5217, 5223, "DATE"], [5267, 5273, "DATE"], [5308, 5312, "PERSON"], [5418, 5428, "NORP"], [5570, 5576, "GPE"]]}
{"text": "Datuk Seri Najib Razak is pictured at the Kuala Lumpur Court Complex February 20, 2019. — Picture by FIrdaus Latif KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 20 — The Criminal High Court was told today that lawyer Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram is unfit to lead the prosecution against Datuk Seri Najib Razak in 1Malaysia Development Berhad-linked (1MDB) cases, as he is allegedly biased and akin to a “hitman”. Najib’s lawyer Harvinder Singh claimed, in an application to disqualify Sri Ram as lead prosecutor, that Sri Ram’s alleged involvement in both investigations and prosecution of the 1MDB cases results in “conflict of interest”. “Once a prosecutor has acted in investigations, he cannot then be prosecutor in court,” he told the Criminal High Court in Kuala Lumpur. Although noting that Sri Ram had in court documents denied conflict of interest, Harvinder listed four points as alleged proof of Sri Ram’s involvement in the two roles, including the attorney general’s August 31, 2018 comment that Sri Ram’s announcement would “enhance the investigation and prosecution” on 1MDB matters. Harvinder also relied on a brief excerpt from the published transcript of Attorney General Tommy Thomas’s interview with the media last September, particularly a line on Sri Ram’s appointed role as prosecutor that said “Sri Ram is to push 1MDB and perhaps argue in Court for two of those cases”. Harvinder claimed Sri Ram’s letter of appointment states that he was to conduct and have supervision of the investigation and prosecution of 1MDB-linked cases. Harvinder said the test is whether a reasonably informed member of the public would come to the conclusion that the “proper administration of justice” requires Sri Ram to be disqualified, in the interests of the protection of the integrity of the judicial process and the due administration of justice, including the appearance of justice. “Any reasonable member of public will have to consider that he is not fit for the case, because he’s not impartial and he’s biased,” he said, later arguing that the 1MDB case is akin to Sri Ram’s “baby” that has been brought from investigation stage to the courts for prosecution. Harvinder said a prosecutor should be “detached” instead of coming to courts with the pre-set idea that an accused is guilty, arguing that Sri Ram would not be “objective” and would not be impartial due to his alleged involvement in the investigation stage. Harvinder highlighted Najib’s right to a fair trial and repeatedly stressed that it was a matter of “perception”. “It’s about perception...Will justice be seen to be done if he also prosecutes? Will it be prosecution or persecution?” he asked. Among other things, Harvinder also highlighted Sri Ram’s previous role as Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s lead defence lawyer in the Sodomy II appeals and his current role as Anwar’s lawyer in a Sodomy II-linked court case against Putrajaya. “Never has there been a situation where a senior DPP is acting for a private person in a suit against the government of Malaysia,” he said. Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, another lawyer representing Najib, said it was important to have an impartial prosecutor in order to have a fair trial, where information would not be withheld from the defence. Deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib today raised a preliminary objection by the prosecution against Najib’s motion to disqualify Sri Ram as prosecutor and also on Najib’s affidavit in response in the matter. “We respectfully submit that the motion is bad from head to foot, and the affidavit is out of order. We ask your Lordship to dismiss the motion because it is a non-starter from the beginning,” he said. Hearing will resume before High Court Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah on Friday morning, with Ahmad Akram expected to respond to the arguments from Najib’s lawyers. On December 21, Najib had applied to disqualify Sri Ram from leading the prosecution of three of his cases — namely 25 charges of money-laundering and power abuse involving more than RM2 billion of 1MDB funds; six charges of criminal breach of trust over RM6.64 billion; and one charge of power abuse involving the alleged tampering of the auditor-general’s 1MDB audit report. Najib had sought for seven orders and declarations, including an order for the prosecution to provide a copy of Sri Ram’s letter of appointment as a senior deputy public prosecutor under Section 376(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Najib also wants a declaration that Sri Ram’s appointment is ultra vires or beyond the powers of the public prosecutor and is therefore null and void; while also asking the courts to declare that Sri Ram is not a “fit and proper person” to have been appointed senior DPP. Najib also wants a declaration that there is a conflict of interest between Sri Ram’s appointment as senior public prosecutor and his continued practice as a lawyer, and a declaration that the latter has acted in conflict of interest of his appointment as senior DPP. This is not the only court bid by Najib to have Sri Ram disqualifed as his lead prosecutor, as he has also filed a separate challenge by seeking a judicial review at the civil High Court in Kuala Lumpur. Earlier today, High Court judge Datuk Azizah Nawawi dismissed Najib’s and Shafee’s separate applications for leave for judicial review to ultimately stop Sri Ram from prosecuting their cases. Azizah said that Najib’s applications in both the civil and criminal courts were seeking for the same results, and that it would be more convenient for the matter to be addressed at the criminal High Court as the main trial was also there. Najib’s lawyers today said that they will appeal Azizah’s decision.", "labels": [[0, 22, "PERSON"], [38, 60, "ORG"], [69, 86, "DATE"], [101, 127, "PERSON"], [171, 176, "DATE"], [189, 213, "PERSON"], [255, 277, "FAC"], [281, 290, "GPE"], [291, 309, "EVENT"], [381, 386, "PERSON"], [396, 411, "PERSON"], [453, 460, "PERSON"], [486, 495, "ORG"], [704, 727, "ORG"], [731, 743, "GPE"], [766, 773, "ORG"], [826, 835, "ORG"], [843, 847, "CARDINAL"], [875, 884, "ORG"], [904, 907, "CARDINAL"], [948, 963, "DATE"], [977, 986, "ORG"], [1158, 1172, "PERSON"], [1198, 1212, "DATE"], [1237, 1246, "ORG"], [1287, 1294, "ORG"], [1332, 1337, "GPE"], [1342, 1345, "CARDINAL"], [1381, 1390, "ORG"], [1683, 1690, "PERSON"], [2049, 2058, "ORG"], [2144, 2153, "ORG"], [2283, 2290, "ORG"], [2424, 2429, "PERSON"], [2666, 2675, "ORG"], [2693, 2702, "ORG"], [2720, 2746, "PERSON"], [2816, 2823, "ORG"], [2872, 2881, "ORG"], [2932, 2935, "ORG"], [3003, 3011, "GPE"], [3023, 3055, "PERSON"], [3085, 3090, "PERSON"], [3260, 3278, "PERSON"], [3279, 3284, "DATE"], [3343, 3350, "ORG"], [3372, 3379, "PERSON"], [3406, 3413, "ORG"], [3680, 3690, "ORG"], [3697, 3721, "PERSON"], [3725, 3731, "DATE"], [3732, 3739, "TIME"], [3746, 3757, "PERSON"], [3800, 3805, "ORG"], [3820, 3831, "DATE"], [3833, 3838, "ORG"], [3865, 3872, "PERSON"], [3905, 3910, "CARDINAL"], [3933, 3935, "CARDINAL"], [3990, 4011, "MONEY"], [4027, 4030, "CARDINAL"], [4092, 4095, "CARDINAL"], [4194, 4199, "PERSON"], [4215, 4220, "CARDINAL"], [4306, 4315, "ORG"], [4381, 4394, "LAW"], [4399, 4426, "LAW"], [4428, 4433, "PERSON"], [4464, 4473, "ORG"], [4624, 4631, "GPE"], [4695, 4698, "ORG"], [4700, 4705, "ORG"], [4776, 4785, "ORG"], [4963, 4966, "ORG"], [5002, 5007, "ORG"], [5016, 5023, "FAC"], [5144, 5154, "ORG"], [5158, 5170, "GPE"], [5172, 5185, "TIME"], [5187, 5197, "ORG"], [5204, 5216, "PERSON"], [5217, 5223, "PERSON"], [5234, 5241, "ORG"], [5246, 5254, "ORG"], [5326, 5333, "PERSON"], [5364, 5370, "PERSON"], [5381, 5388, "ORG"], [5559, 5569, "ORG"], [5604, 5609, "ORG"], [5620, 5625, "DATE"], [5653, 5659, "GPE"]]}
{"text": "PETALING JAYA: Government departments should have an internal mechanism to check the authenticity of qualifications submitted by civil servants to prevent unscrupulous individuals from submitting false documents for promotions. Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) director of investigations Datuk Mustafar Ali said that although the process of checking and verifying documents would be laborious and time-consuming, it was necessary to prevent civil servants from cheating. “Government departments should consider this option as there are incidents where people falsify their documents in order to be given a higher position. “Although such incidents are rare, it is worth considering, especially when the Government wants to ensure its employees are honest and are people of high integrity,” he said. Mustafar was commenting on a report where a female doctor in a government department was caught falsifying documents in order to move up the ranks. He said the 39-year-old doctor, who was a director of a department in a state, would be charged today. He added that this case was rare “but nonetheless worrying”. “Civil servants or anyone for that matter must realise that a promotion is given based on merit. One should not resort to cheating just to gain a promotion,” Mustafar said. Public Service Department director-general Tan Sri Abu Bakar Abdullah, who described the case as isolated, said he would direct the concerned department to submit a report. “We will have to check the allegations that documents she submitted were falsified. However, I hope the public will not have any negative perception because this is an isolated incident,” he added. Abu Bakar said civil servants' service records were “usually intact”, adding that each promotion would be decided by a committee at the ministry and the department depending on the grade and position of the employee.", "labels": [[228, 264, "ORG"], [266, 270, "ORG"], [299, 317, "PERSON"], [714, 724, "ORG"], [1054, 1059, "DATE"], [1219, 1222, "CARDINAL"], [1295, 1320, "ORG"], [1338, 1364, "PERSON"], [1666, 1675, "PERSON"]]}

Police seized various house break-in tools and stolen items, including televisions, air- conditioning units and hi-fi sets worth over RM50,000. Three of the gang members had been out on bail after being charged in court for committing house break-ins last year. Kajang OCPD Asst Comm Abdul Rashid Abdul Wahab said police raided a house in Damai Perdana at about 2am and detained the four and the 25-year-old GRO who was engaged by the gang for “pleasure”. “We also recovered various modified house break-in tools such as master keys, portable oxy gas, welding and cutting tools in the rented house. “In a follow-up operation, we arrested two siblings in Cheras Perdana and seized an assortment of stolen electrical items. “All the suspects, aged between 25 and 41, were involved in at least nine house break-ins in Kajang,” he said here yesterday. ACP Abdul Rashid said the gang would conduct surveillance and break into the houses when the occupants were not in. He said the gang had also installed a closed-circuit television system on their rented hideouts to monitor outsiders. “We are still looking for three accomplices,” he said.

We find The Sedition Act 1948 a good law that is not ultra vires (beyond the power) of the constitution, said Zulkefli, in his judgement on Monday. He added that the Act was within the scope of Article 10 (2) of the Federal Constitution, which imposed restrictions on freedom of speech. The panel, also comprising judges Suriyadi Halim Omar, Hasan Lah, Zaleha Zahari and Zainun Ali, unanimously dismissed the appeal brought by Uthayakumar against the Court of Appeal decision. The Court of Appeal had upheld the Kuala Lumpur High Court decision on Jan 26 last year to dismiss Uthayakumar's motion seeking an order that the Sedition Act 1948 is void in accordance with Article 4(1) of the Federal Constitution. Article 4(1) proclaims the supremacy of the Federal Constitution and states that any law passed after Merdeka Day, which is inconsistent with the Constitution, shall be void. Uthayakumar, 50, a former Internal Security Act detainee, was charged in the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court on Dec 11, 2007, with publishing a seditious letter on the 'Police Watch Malaysia' website, dated Nov 15, 2007, addressed to then-prime minister of Britain, Gordon Brown. He made the declaratory application (to declare the Sedition Act unconstitutional), in a bid to have the charge against him under the Act to be revoked and the prosecution in the proceedings in the Sessions Court be struck out. The trial of his case is pending at the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court which has fixed July 18 for case mention.

The 32-year-old woman, who arrived from Doha, was nabbed at around 7.30pm at the Low-Cost Carrier Terminal on June 16. “The suspect was brought to the Serdang Hospital for an X-ray which revealed she had ingested 28 capsules,” KLIA Customs Department director Badaruddin Mohamed Rafik told a press conference at the Sepang Customs Complex yesterday. He said initial investigations revealed that the capsules contained about 394.43gm of syabu with a street value of RM98,607.50. In addition to this, two men from Romania and India were arrested on June 26 and 27 respectively. He added that the Customs Department foiled three attempts to traffic syabu and ketamine through the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) and Low-Cost Carrier Terminal with the seizure of over RM1.03mil of drugs. “We also arrested a 20-year-old Romanian man at around 11.55pm on June 26 after noticing suspicious-looking packages in his luggage as it passed through the scanner. “We conducted a thorough check on the bag which revealed a hidden compartment containing about 3.29kg of syabu, worth at least RM824,000,” he said, adding that investigations revealed the man had come from Manila. Badaruddin said a 42-year-old Indian man was arrested at 2.35am the next day after a customs officer noticed something suspicious in his luggage. A hidden compartment in his luggage was found to contain about 2.86kg of ketamine with a street value of RM114,400. The man had arrived on a flight from Calcutta to LCCT. He said the Romanian and Indian man have been remanded while the Nigerian woman has been charged with drug trafficking.

With its body made up of 400 flattened tin cans, the prototype car fits one adult driver and at RM7,000, it is perhaps among the most cost-efficient cars to build. The vehicle, designed by a team of students from Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), is among 120 eco-friendly mobiles competing in the Shell Eco-Marathon Asia 2012 competition. UPM Green Blitz team manager Abdulrahman Yousif Abdullah, a fourth year mechanical engineering student, said the car had been tested on the road to make 200km on just one litre of fuel. “Except for the engine, all other parts of the car are made from reusable items, including the headlights and the windscreen. “Our goal is to achieve a remarkable distance with the car using just one litre of fuel,” Abdulrahman said at the Sepang International Circuit here yesterday. The team from Univer-siti Kebangsaan Malaysia invented a dual-powered vehicle using battery and solar energy for the urban concept car category. The 170kg car took eight months to develop and costs RM40,000 to build, said third year mechanical engineering student Neo Rong Gen. “We have placed eight solar-powered panels on our car. On a fully-charged battery and with good sunlight, the car can run up to 20km,” Neo said. Launched in 2009, the Shell Eco-Marathon Asia is a competition to challenge high school and tertiary students to design and build energy-efficient vehicles that can travel the furthest using the least amount of fuel.

{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: An interim taskforce should be set up to draft a White Paper and set the parameters for a review of the controversial amendments to the Evidence Act 1950. In a statement, Bar Council chairman Lim Chee Wee said the Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) should set up the taskforce to address concerns over amendments to the Evidence Act. The amendments were passed in April and gazetted on June 31 but since then controversy has raged over Section 114(a). Its detractors claim that the section provides the authorities more power to charge those posting comments on the Internet even if made by others. Moreover, those charged would have to disprove their alleged wrongdoing although the comments might have been posted by hackers. It was reported that several Barisan Nasional MPs, who were unhappy with the changes, are planning to submit a request to the Government for a review of the Act. Over the weekend, Deputy Higher Education Minister Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah and Umno Youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin said they would lobby the Government to change the controversial clause. The Centre for Independent Journalism Malaysia has called on Netizens to participate in an “Internet Blackout Day” today to create awareness on the issue. Lim said Section 114(a) of the Act should be repealed as it contained the presumption that any registered user of a network service was the publisher of a publication sent from a computer linked to that network service. “Such a section would create a presumption that is so wide that even the owner of a coffee shop that offered free WiFi could be presumed to have published an online publication from a computer using the WiFi facilities,” he added.", "labels": [[0, 5, "ORG"], [63, 74, "ORG"], [185, 196, "ORG"], [206, 218, "PERSON"], [224, 271, "ORG"], [276, 330, "ORG"], [405, 421, "LAW"], [453, 458, "DATE"], [475, 482, "DATE"], [525, 538, "LAW"], [846, 866, "ORG"], [943, 953, "ORG"], [974, 977, "NORP"], [984, 995, "DATE"], [1030, 1054, "PERSON"], [1059, 1069, "PERSON"], [1076, 1093, "PERSON"], [1120, 1130, "ORG"], [1167, 1213, "ORG"], [1228, 1236, "ORG"], [1322, 1325, "PERSON"], [1331, 1344, "LAW"], [1353, 1356, "PRODUCT"]]}

They comprised eight people involved in human smuggling syndicates while the others were involved in terrorism. Seven are Malaysians, three Indonesians and two Pakis­tanis. “The release was done after the Government was satisfied that they had undergone the needed rehabilitation, realised the offences they had committed and are no longer a threat to national security based on reports by the police,” Hishammuddin told reporters during a visit to Sungai Buloh Prison yesterday. With the release, the Government has freed a total of 25 people arrested under the ISA since the law was repealed and replaced with the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act, which came into effect on July 31. Hishammuddin said among the offences committed by the eight who were involved in human smuggling-related activities included forging the Immigration Depart­ment’s entry and exit passport stamps and forging Malaysian and international passports. The four involved in terrorism were linked to two groups – Darul Islam and Jemaah Islamiah. With yesterday’s release, Hisham­muddin said there were 11 Ma­­laysians and 19 foreigners who are still under detention under the ISA. “With the enforcement of the new Security Offences Act, we can review the position of the remaining detainees under the ISA to find out whether they should be charged in court or sent back to their home countries in the case of the non-Malaysians.” On the Janji Bersih gathering being organised by a group of non-governmental organisations on the eve of the Merdeka celebrations at Dataran Merdeka in Kuala Lumpur, Hisham­muddin said any group whose actions jeopardised security would face action.", "labels": [[14, 42, "LAW"], [44, 47, "ORG"], [93, 103, "ORG"], [114, 123, "DATE"], [139, 149, "PERSON"], [164, 171, "PERSON"], [193, 198, "CARDINAL"], [290, 295, "CARDINAL"], [300, 310, "NORP"], [312, 317, "CARDINAL"], [318, 329, "NORP"], [334, 337, "CARDINAL"], [383, 393, "ORG"], [581, 593, "PERSON"], [647, 656, "DATE"], [680, 690, "ORG"], [712, 714, "CARDINAL"], [741, 744, "ORG"], [790, 834, "ORG"], [862, 869, "DATE"], [871, 883, "PERSON"], [925, 930, "CARDINAL"], [1077, 1086, "NORP"], [1120, 1124, "CARDINAL"], [1162, 1165, "CARDINAL"], [1175, 1186, "PERSON"], [1191, 1206, "PERSON"], [1213, 1222, "DATE"], [1234, 1247, "PERSON"], [1264, 1266, "CARDINAL"], [1338, 1341, "ORG"], [1376, 1397, "LAW"], [1463, 1466, "ORG"], [1575, 1589, "NORP"], [1599, 1611, "PERSON"], [1701, 1708, "LOC"], [1725, 1740, "ORG"], [1744, 1756, "GPE"], [1758, 1771, "ORG"]]}

BSA, an international trade organisation which represents software and hardware manufacturers, received the tip-offs through its anti-piracy hotline this year. One of the calls led to a raid on the premises of a solution provider here by Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry enforcement officers on Wedneday. The officers seized 83 copies of software suspected to have infringed copyrights and which were installed in the computers, said the ministry’s state enforcement director Abdul Rosik Yakub yesterday. The seized software is commonly used for photo-editing, computer-aided design, operating systems and word processing. Abdul Rosik said investigations were under way and that the company would be charged in court if there were enough evidence. Wednesday’s BSA-initiated raid, codenamed Ops Tulen, was the 11th this year. The others were carried out in the peninsula (nine) and Sabah (one), and resulted in the seizure of about RM1.6mil worth of suspected pirated software and hardware products. BSA marketing director (Asia) Roland Chan said the software belonged to its members, including Autodesk and Adobe. “As the deadline for companies to submit to the BSA software audit programme to receive a one-year immunity (from its initiated enforcement raid) is now over, raids are in full swing,” Chan said. He said BSA was rewarding an informant up to RM20,000 for a tip-off leading to successful enforcement action. Chan declined, however, to say how much in rewards it had paid out since Ops Tulen was launched in 2002.

It expressed its disappointment with the council's objection to the proposed amendments, as contained in recent newspaper reports. The Parliamentary Select Committee on the Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code proposed to table a new sub-section 375 (f) of the Penal Code, which states that a man commits aggravated rape if he has sex with a woman “with her consent, when the consent is obtained by using his position of authority over her or because of professional or other relationship of trust in relation to her.” According to JAG, the intention behind the sub-section is to protect women forced into sex by the use of non-physical elements such as the perpetrator’s authority over the woman – for example when trainers, physicians, bomohs, mediums or therapists engage in sex with their clients. All Women’s Action Society (Awam) executive director Honey Tan Lay Ean said in a statement: “Consent in a situation like that should be deemed invalid and inoperative.” JAG welcomed the acknowledgment of the need to impose a more severe punishment reflecting the heinous nature of the crime, as proposed by the Select Committee in its report. On another proposed amendment that a husband causing hurt in order to have sexual intercourse shall be imprisoned, the Bar Council did not object to it. “The council did, however, confirm a lack of appreciation of the concept of violence against women when it required that the wives must be “actually physically hurt” into having sexual intercourse with their husbands in order for the husbands to be charged,” said Tan.", "labels": [[15, 57, "ORG"], [59, 62, "ORG"], [133, 150, "ORG"], [177, 187, "ORG"], [331, 365, "ORG"], [369, 411, "LAW"], [459, 473, "LAW"], [734, 737, "ORG"], [1004, 1030, "ORG"], [1057, 1074, "PERSON"], [1173, 1176, "ORG"], [1311, 1331, "ORG"], [1462, 1477, "ORG"], [1764, 1767, "PERSON"]]}

The meeting will be scheduled “as soon as possible” and will involve representatives from the group, the Finance Ministry, Bank Negara and Bestino Golden House Sdn Bhd managing director Chong Yuk Ming. “The meeting will explore how the gold bars and the RM24.2mil (confiscated by Bank Negara from Bestino) will be handled,” special officer Ravin Ponniah said when addressing the crowd.

{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: The UN special envoy to Myanmar Tan Sri Razali Ismail said yesterday he has given up the job, expressing frustration with the country's military junta for refusing to reconcile with pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Razali, a veteran Malaysian diplomat, said his U.N. contract expired on Jan 3, and he decided not to get it renewed because of the Myanmar junta's stonewalling, which has kept him out of the country for nearly two years. “I have not been allowed to go back for the past 23 months,'' said Razali. “There is no justification for me to go on.'' Razali criticised the Myanmar government for not being “open'' about its commitment to democracy. Razali cautioned that the United Nations must remain engaged with Myanmar. “They must find someone else who is more acceptable to Myanmar.” In Yangon, NLD spokesman and Secretary U Lwin praised Razali's efforts, even though they remained largely fruitless. Razali is “a close friend of ours who had tried his utmost for the good of the country. He has been charged with the difficult task but had done his best in his capacity as a facilitator.'' Razali was appointed a special envoy of the UN Secretary General in April 2000 on a contract renewable every six months.

{"text": "ALOR STAR: The marriage between self-professed billionaire Elie Youssef Najem and Farinnie Mohd Farid in 2004 could not have been solemnised by the imam stated in the marriage certificate. That's because the iman died 10 years ago, said Kedah Islamic Religious Department head Datuk Sheikh Kassim Daud. “We checked further and discovered that Najem was holding a forged certificate. Even the wedding venue was wrong and the serial number of the certificate belonged to another couple,” he said. He said the department believed that the wedding certificate owned by Najem was produced by a syndicate that ran a “wedding operation” in the state. “We will lodge a police report,” he told newsmen here yesterday. IN KUALA LUMPUR, more people have approached MCA Public Services and Complaints Department head Datuk Michael Chong with complaints against Najem. IT consultant S. Ravi claimed he was hired as an IT consultant last year with an offer of RM450,000 per annum. But he received only RM900 for three months' work. Najem’s former landlord Hendra Wirawan Rusli claimed that Najem’s RM5,874 cheque for four months' rent bounced. Another creditor John Lim said Najem reneged on payments for an order of Belgian chocolates that cost more than RM1,000. Chong urged people to highlight problems in any dealings with Najem so that other Malaysians would not be duped by him. Deputy Inspector-General of Police Datuk Seri Musa Hassan said police had been keeping tabs on Najem since last year. “There were five reports against him last year and he was charged with three. “The cases take time to investigate.

{"text": "PETALING JAYA: Malaysian companies exporting goods to Australia will have to pay about four times more to get their cargo fumigated before they reach their destination. This is because beginning Dec 1 last year, companies handling fumigation services have to comply with the rigid Australian Fumigation Accreditation Scheme (Afas) and Australian Quarantine and Inspection Services (Aqis) standards. According to the Pest Control Association of Malaysia’s Afas sub-committee chairman Syed Shahran Syed Mohammed, companies complying with the standards were charging between RM250 and RM600 for a 20-foot (6m) container and between RM400 and RM800 for a 40-foot (12m) container. They used to charge RM80 for a 20-footer and RM150 for a 40-footer. “I received many calls from our clients who could not believe the new pricing,” Syed Shahran said. “However, I explained to them that there was nothing that we could do but comply. Otherwise, the containers will surely be rejected.” He said the fumigation process involved using expensive plastic tarpaulin sheets which were impervious to gas. “Methyl bromide is used to fumigate the containers and it is difficult to contain such gases. On top of that, fumigation companies have to buy gas monitoring and gas leak devices,” he added. Syed Shahran said compliance with the Australian standards was good because it would ensure high standards of fumigation in Malaysia. “Afas is one of the leading authorities on fumigation and very soon, its standards will be adopted around the world,” he said yesterday. Syed Shahran said only 34 companies out of 60 in Malaysia were accredited to carry out such fumigation services. He said that Aqis would inspect containers that arrived in Australia and if they failed the inspection, RM6,000 would be charged to re-fumigate the containers.", "labels": [[15, 24, "NORP"], [54, 63, "GPE"], [81, 91, "CARDINAL"], [195, 210, "DATE"], [281, 323, "LAW"], [325, 329, "ORG"], [335, 380, "ORG"], [412, 440, "ORG"], [444, 452, "GPE"], [455, 459, "ORG"], [483, 495, "PERSON"], [496, 509, "PERSON"], [572, 577, "PERSON"], [582, 587, "PERSON"], [603, 604, "CARDINAL"], [629, 634, "PERSON"], [639, 644, "ORG"], [660, 662, "CARDINAL"], [721, 726, "PERSON"], [1279, 1291, "PERSON"], [1317, 1327, "NORP"], [1403, 1411, "GPE"], [1414, 1418, "ORG"], [1539, 1548, "DATE"], [1550, 1562, "PERSON"], [1568, 1575, "CARDINAL"], [1593, 1595, "CARDINAL"], [1599, 1607, "GPE"], [1676, 1680, "ORG"], [1722, 1731, "GPE"]]}

Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Mohamad Hassan said areas such as Seremban 2, Seremban 3 and Bandar Baru Nilai, which used to have rural status, would be reclassified as urban areas. There will also be reclassification for other types of land use, including homesteads, golf courses, commercial memorial parks, private hospitals and land owned by the Federal Government. “We have decided to revise the land use. There are a lot of areas with new status, including homesteads such as Planter’s Haven, which used to be classified as agricultural land,” he told reporters yesterday after chairing the weekly executive committee meeting. “As for Nilai Memorial Park, the quit rent used to be RM6 per acre (0.4ha) but they are selling one lot for about RM50,000.” Mohamad said land without any change in status would see an increase of 5% in quit rent while that which had been reclassified and given urban status would be the most affected, with an increase of up to 200%. The old rates, he said, did not reflect the true status of the land. “In fact, the owners should have been paying the new rates about 15 years ago when the areas were developed into urban areas,” he added. Standardising rates for land owned by the Federal Government, Mohamad added, would make matters easier as certain districts had charged quit rent “according to their whims and fancies”.

He said the companies were caught for violating various regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 and the Factory and Machinery Act 1967. “All we asked from them was to, at least, apply some basic safety procedures and even that, some failed to comply,” he said after chairing his ministry’s post-Cabinet meeting yesterday. “These companies were found to have committed serious faults at their construction sites. “Construction firms must realise the importance of following these procedures as it involves not only the safety of their workers but the public's as well. “I hope this will serve as a lesson to all on how serious this ministry is in ensuring construction sites are safe.” Of the 34 firms that would be charged in court for violating safety regulations, nine were carrying out construction projects in Kuala Lumpur and eight in Selangor. Dr Fong said eight of the 34 firms were found to have committed offences during the Chinese New Year festivities. On another matter, the minister said the Cabinet had approved yesterday the National Skills Development Bill, and that it would be tabled in the coming Parliament session. “The Ministry is excited about having the Bill passed, and the Act enforced, so that we can internationalise local skills training programmes and get foreign students to take up courses here,” he said. “It will also enable the ministry and the National Vocational Training Council to benchmark the programmes to turn out workers with the skills and knowledge that employers look for.”", "labels": [[11, 22, "CARDINAL"], [112, 140, "ORG"], [245, 253, "PERSON"], [254, 267, "PERSON"], [425, 459, "ORG"], [684, 693, "DATE"], [1065, 1067, "CARDINAL"], [1139, 1143, "CARDINAL"], [1187, 1199, "GPE"], [1204, 1209, "CARDINAL"], [1213, 1221, "PERSON"], [1226, 1230, "PERSON"], [1236, 1241, "CARDINAL"], [1249, 1251, "CARDINAL"], [1303, 1323, "EVENT"], [1378, 1385, "ORG"], [1399, 1408, "DATE"], [1409, 1445, "ORG"], [1489, 1499, "ORG"], [1514, 1522, "ORG"], [1551, 1555, "PERSON"], [1572, 1575, "PRODUCT"], [1749, 1789, "ORG"]]}

Chin said a few months ago, Pos Malaysia had disallowed printed matter mail, forcing the organisation to send the newsletters in sealed envelopes. Postage for printed mail now costs 20 sen each. In contrast, postage for mail in sealed envelopes costs 50 sen each. “This is simply outrageous. We are a non-profit organisation and our members are retirees without a steady income. “It is also not practical to write out the addresses on the envelopes of all 2,000 newsletters,” he said.

Anwar said his next stop would be Turkey where he would give a talk on “Islam, Freedom and Justice” on Jan 12. He said he was invited by the Turkish Government. Speaking to reporters later, he said it did not matter whether he was found guilty or not on the sodomy charge at the Kuala Lumpur High Court “as long as Pakatan Rakyat can take over Putrajaya.” Pakatan's victory in the next general election was more important that his own freedom, he said. “I am confident that we can take over Putrajaya with the support of all the component parties in Pakatan. “With the latest development in politics, I am optimistic about Pakatan's prospects of winning (the election).

He said that at no time did he order any officers under his command to box in the protesters in the underpass, adding that he did not know at the time there were officers firing tear gas at the other end. “I only found out there were shots fired from the other side (of the underpass) at the end of the operation, not at the time of the operation,” he told a public inquiry on alleged human rights violations by the authorities during the July 9 rally.

The teams were later ordered to gather at the underpass exit to set up a blockade after some 600 protesters had gathered there. He noted however that two of the teams never made it in time. Wan Abdul Bari said he could not wait for the two other teams to arrive before issuing the order to fire a total of 14 tear gas canisters, as he claimed the protesters' frontlines had formed a human chain allegedly led by PKR vice-president Tian Chua and charged on the police blockade.

He said they would be “duly dealt with” under the Public Land Transport Act 2010 if nabbed. “Those days, the fine was only RM300 and most cases did not have to go to court but under the new Act, investigation papers are immediately opened when offenders are apprehended,” said Che Hasni during SPAD's special enforcement operations at Pudu Sentral. Offenders could be fined up to RM50,000 under Section 75 of the Act, he added.

Buses which have not been inspected and do not have the LPS would not have insurance. This is very dangerous,” he said.

DCP Tun Hisan said police investigations paid off when they arrested three men in Rawang on Thursday who, on questioning, led them to the arrest of another suspect in Sabak Bernam and another eight men in Simpang, Taiping, Perak. He added that the four of the syndicate members detained last year had been charged.

{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR: A suspect wanted in the case of a missing South Korean expatriate who was believed to have been murdered in Malaysia was found dead in a police cell in South Korea. It is learnt that prison wardens found the suspect hanged last week. South Korean authorities arrested the suspect, in his 50s, in Macau in December, two months after he was believed to have murdered Kim Chong-yong, who was president of the Korean Sports Council in Malaysia. A police source said the suspect was the only witness who could lead them to the discovery of Kim’s body. He said South Korean police had almost completed their investigations and were about to charge the suspect in court for several high-profile cases. Among the cases he was about to be charged with were kidnapping, cheating and Kim’s murder. It was reported that police had identified the suspect after viewing the CCTV footage at a condominium in Ampang where the suspect stayed whenever he came to Malaysia. The footage showed Kim arriving at the condominium with the suspect on Oct 29, the night Kim was reported missing. Hours later, the suspect was seen walking out of the condominium alone with a luggage bag, which he was struggling to carry out of the lift. Police then raided the unit and found bloodstains inside. It was reported earlier that the victim was last seen in the Mont Kiara area where he had met an acquaintance on Oct 29.

Magistrate Zuhair Rosli said the claim by Zainol Fitri Hassan, 39, from Kulim near here, that his brakes failed could not be supported. Witnesses testified he was driving recklessly. The location of the accident was a toll plaza and the accused had ample opportunity to avoid the accident, Zuhair said after hearing final submissions from the prosecution and defence on Sunday. He said the defence had failed to raise any reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case. He also fined Zainil Fitri RM9,000. Zainol Fitri was charged with committing the offence at the the Hutan Kampung toll plaza (northbound) at KM41.3 of the North-South Expressway at around 3.50pm on May 29 2007. In mitigation, Zainol Fitri, represented by counsel Prem Singh, pleaded for a lenient sentence saying he had a wife and two children to support. He also asked for a stay of the sentences pending appeal to the High Court. However, Deputy Public Prosecutor Suzanne Tiyon Bimen urged the court to impose a heavy sentence as his action caused nine people from four families to lose their lives. Four families (in four cars queing up to pay toll) lost their loves ones because of his rash action. One person was also seriously injured and had to have a leg amputated, she said. Zuhair said he had to impose a sentence that gave justice to the victims and also serve as a deterrent to other drivers to be more responsible when on the roads. He also ordered the accused's driver's licence to be suspended for four years effective today. Zuhair also stayed the sentences pending appeal but set bail at RM10,000 in one surety.

{"text": "PUTRAJAYA: An attempt to export 8,000 pieces of pirated DVDs, including latest box-office hits such as Basic Instinct 2, Ice Age 2 and V for Vendetta, to Johannesburg, South Africa, was thwarted by Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry enforcement officers during a routine check on Tuesday night. Deputy director-general (operations) Iskandar Halim Sulaiman said the pirated goods, worth about RM80,000, were discovered at the cargo area in KL International Airport at 9.30pm. “Our officers became suspicious on noticing that the cargo was wrapped and marked as computer parts. They ordered the wrapping to be removed and found the DVDs in seven cartons,” he told reporters here yesterday. “This is the latest in a series of raids on such exports in recent weeks.” Iskandar said the ministry’s export unit had also foiled an attempt to ship 7,000 pieces of VCDs and DVDs worth some RM45,000 to Cambodia on April 13, and 36,000 pieces of DVD games to Montevideo, Uruguay, on April 8. “In the first four months of this year alone, we seized 363,000 pieces of pirated DVDs, music CDs and games software worth RM3.3mil,” he said. “This is a huge number because we only seized 712,000 pieces of such goods worth RM5.9mil marked for export during the whole of last year.” Iskandar said the unit had identified the international airports in Kuching, Kota Kinabalu and Johor Baru as “gateways” for such exports in addition to KLIA. “In total, the enforcement division confiscated close to RM51.3mil worth of pirated ware in the first four months of this year, compared with RM100.4mil for the whole of last year,” he added.
