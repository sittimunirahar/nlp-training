		("The seven detainees held by the DB police over question paper leak on December 8, 2018 Collected USB drives, Bluetooth devices, SIM cards and mobile phones were also recovered in the drive Detective Branch (DB) of Police has detained seven people for their alleged involvement in leaking question papers of recruitment examinations through electronic devices. Shohel Rana, Mahmudul, Ansarul Islam, Debasis, Rabiul Auwal, Rajiur Rahman and Rejaul Karim were arrested from Dhaka's Mirpur, Kalabagan and Shiddeshwari areas on Friday. The detainees were also allegedly involved in helping people cheat in the recruitment test for Department of Narcotics Control (DNC). The DB police also recovered USB drives, Bluetooth devices, SIM cards and mobile phones from the possession of the detainees. DMP Deputy Commissioner Masudur Rahman, in a press briefing on Saturday, said: “Among the detainees, Shohel has been held before for the same offense, but he had secured bail later.” He said they were also involved in leaking question papers of different recruitment examinations. Masudur Rahman said in the preliminary interrogation, they learned that this time they had leaked the question papers of DNC recruitment test. He said: “We also found out that among the detainees, three sat for the exam with electronic devices. “Later, they sent the question papers to the other four, who solved the problem and resend the solutions to their clients.” The deputy commissioner said they charged Tk5 to 10 lakh for the work. However, the payments were made after the clients passed their exams. He said: “We filed a case against with Ramna police station. We have submitted a request to the court seeking permission for remanding them.”", {"entities": [(1621, 1626, "LOC"), (1483, 1486, "MONEY"), (1490, 1497, "MONEY"), (626, 663, "ORG"), (501, 513, "LOC"), (479, 485, "LOC"), (487, 496, "LOC"), (471, 476, "GPE"), (407, 419, "PERSON"), (398, 405, "PERSON"), (1368, 1372, "CARDINAL"), (1269, 1274, "CARDINAL"), (1193, 1196, "ORG"), (1072, 1086, "PERSON"), (892, 898, "PERSON"), (854, 862, "DATE"), (815, 829, "PERSON"), (523, 529, "DATE"), (439, 451, "PERSON"), (421, 434, "PERSON"), (383, 396, "PERSON"), (373, 381, "PERSON"), (360, 371, "PERSON"), (234, 239, "CARDINAL"), (70, 86, "DATE"), (4, 9, "CARDINAL")]},
		("KUALA LUMPUR: The Youth, Wanita and Puteri wings of Umno were in combative mood, with their leaders striking hard at their Opposition counterparts. Wanita chief Datuk Seri Shahrizat Abdul Jalil expressed surprise that her PKR rival Zuraida Kamaruddin “had the audacity” to demand her resignation over the National Feedlot Corporation controversy. She dared Zuraida to ask her party president Datuk Seri Wan Azizah Ismail to step down because her husband, Opposition Leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, “had been found guilty and charged with various offences which I don't even have the heart to say out loud”. This, said Shahrizat, would be in accordance with Zuraida's logic behind blaming a person for the actions of his or her spouse. For his part, Umno Youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin mocked his PKR nemesis, Shamsul Iskandar Mohd Akin, for suggesting that Umno change the Federal Constitution so that only a Malay can be Prime Minister. He said PKR suggested such a proposal only because it realised that its support among the Malays was waning.

Kota Kinabalu acting district police chief Supt George Abd Rakman said the suspects, aged 67 and 37 respectively, were apprehended on Tuesday, two days after the 1am incident on June 2. “The two men will be charged in court tomorrow and we are still looking for several other individuals involved in the incident,” he said in a statement here, today. Footage from a closed-circuit television camera (CCTV) that later went viral on social media showed a couple being beaten up in front of shop at the Api-Api Centre. George said the male victim, a Pakistani and his wife were assaulted by a group of individuals due to property rental issues. “Just before the incident, the victims, who were renting the property concerned, were approached by a woman and man, and a discussion among them turned into a heated argument before escalating into a physical fight that involved the father and brother of the landlord,” George said. The case is being investigated under Section 147 of the Penal Code which provides for a jail term of up to two years, or a fine, or both, upon conviction. — Bernama", "annotation_approver": "nlp_admin", {"entities": [(397, 410, "GPE"), (1423, 1438, "DATE"), (1374, 1388, "LAW"), (1359, 1370, "LAW"), (1309, 1315, "PERSON"), (944, 953, "NORP"), (913, 919, "PERSON"), (893, 911, "FAC"), (797, 801, "ORG"), (741, 746, "DATE"), (621, 629, "DATE"), (588, 591, "CARDINAL"), (575, 581, "DATE"), (559, 562, "QUANTITY"), (540, 548, "DATE"), (531, 538, "DATE"), (494, 496, "CARDINAL"), (487, 489, "CARDINAL"), (440, 462, "PERSON"), (318, 336, "FAC"), (221, 224, "CARDINAL"), (187, 193, "DATE"), (168, 185, "PERSON"), (122, 140, "FAC"), (25, 28, "CARDINAL")]},
		("When the Finance Minister tabled Budget 2013 and reduced personal income tax rate by 1%, some quarters have asked if this brings us one step closer to the GST. EVER grumbled about having to pay the RM50 government tax for your credit card each year? Well, the good news is there will be no more such tax if the proposed GST (goods and services tax) is implemented. And you will pay GST on the credit card only if your bank charges you for the card. “These days, banks are offering credits cards for free and giving waivers on annual subscription. If the card is free, there will be no GST on it,” says Customs Department director-general Datuk Khazali Ahmad in an interview. He stresses that key sectors like the financial services, public transport, healthcare, education and residential housing will be exempt from GST. This essentially means that education, medical care, bus and train tickets as well as highway tolls will still be just as affordable as today. Thus, the lower income groups will not be burdened by the GST. When it comes to insurance, Khazali says, if it is a life policy (including education, investment-linked and endowment), no GST will be imposed. But if it is a general insurance policy for medical, fire, motor, burglary, then the normal GST rate (proposed at 4%) will apply. Despite the GST being a fairer, more effective and transparent taxation system and one that has been successfully implemented in 146 countries, it has not been easy to push the idea through in Malaysia. In fact, the government has been talking about the GST for more than two decades now (even when Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim was the Finance Minister in the 1990s). In December 2009, the GST bill was tabled in parliament for first reading but it was withdrawn on April 19 this year for amendments. The Finance Ministry on its website has asked the public for views and feedback on the proposed GST. With public awareness still very low on how GST works, it might be years before it actually comes to fruition. People are still not aware that their basic needs will be protected under the proposed GST regime because essential food items like rice, meat, fish, seafood, chicken, vegetables, cooking oil and salt will be “zero-rated”, which means there will no GST imposed. Critical services like schools, financial services, hospitals, roads and public transport will be “GST-exempt”, which means the consumer will be exempted from paying GST on them. And if you buy a flight ticket to a destination abroad, you will not have to pay GST. “You will be charged GST only on goods and services (which are not zero or exempt-rated) that you consume in the country what you consume outside the country will not be subject to a local GST. A flight ticket abroad and overseas travel is consumption outside Malaysia, so you don't pay GST here on it,” says Khazali. The GST is a consumption-based tax where the tax is borne by the person who consumes the goods or services. Ultimately, it should reduce business costs because manufacturers, distributors and suppliers are able to claim back the GST they paid on goods and services acquired for the purpose of their business. And these businesses are supposed to pass those savings down to the consumer, which should result in lower prices. Khazali says people find it hard to accept the GST even though it benefits them because “tax” is never a popular subject. “Generally, nobody likes to be taxed or, rather, the word “tax” is taboo to many. “However, governments all over the world need to impose tax to get the revenue to provide their citizens with their social needs, employment, security and so forth.” Educating consumers on the GST, he admits, is not easy because the moment you say that GST is a form of tax, “you will be faced with a wall of resistance”. “So we have to explain the GST and its benefits to the people continuously to avoid or eliminate whatever misconception they have about it,” he adds. Khazali also notes that most people do not know that the GST actually replaces the current sales and services tax which they have already been paying on a lot of goods and services because it is embedded in the price of what they buy. Under the current system, by the time the goods reach the consumers, the sales tax that is paid at the manufacturers level would have cascaded at each level of the distribution and the supply chain, and this results in a higher price. But with the GST, since businesses at every stage are able to get a refund on the GST paid on the goods and services acquired or used for the purpose of their business, this will eliminate the cascading effect suffered under the current sales and services taxes. And because of this, an immediate reduction in prices should be seen for goods and services where people have all along been paying an embedded sales tax. He also stresses that the government has repeatedly emphasised that the people will have to understand the GST first before the government actually implements it. “The public should not have any fear over GST. It is a form of consumption tax which has been implemented in nearly 150 countries in the world, whether developed or developing, so there must be something good about it. “ He says the GST is also supposed to result in cheaper prices for imported goods. At present, unless exempted, imported goods are subject to an import duty and sales tax. With the GST replacing the sales tax (5% to 10%), imported goods will still be subject to an import duty and a GST; but because the proposed GST rate is lower than the existing sales tax, consumers should be paying less. Before implementing the GST too, he says, the government will also educate businesses on the need to pass down the savings they get from the GST refund, and set up a mechanism to stop businesses from trying to profiteer from it. For him, the GST is a good thing because it will reduce business costs, lead to more competitive pricing, make exports more competitive because exports will be zero-rated (meaning no GST), increase gross domestic production and reduce grey economy activities. Khazali also believes there might be a change in consumption pattern with the GST because the GST works on the affordability concept. “Consumers have to decide which goods or services to buy. They pay GST only when the goods or services are consumed. So they may divert more of their expenses towards essential goods and services rather than on luxury goods.” Khazali also points out that if the GST is implemented here at the proposed rate of 4%, it will be the lowest rate in the region. Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos charge a 10% GST rate, Philippines 12% and Singapore 7%. But what is to stop the government from hiking the rate after it has been implemented? Khazali cites past experiences, saying Malaysia increased its sales tax rate only once from 5% in 1972 (year of implementation) to 10% in 1983 and service tax rate too increased only once, from 5% in 1975 (year of implementation) to 6% in 2011. There are still nuts and bolts to sort out with implementing the GST here, including tabling a new bill for it, putting an anti-profiteering mechanism in place, getting public understanding and acceptance on it. For now, it looks like it is still quite a long journey away.", "annotation_approver": "nlp_admin", {"entities": [(198, 202, "MONEY"), (40, 44, "DATE"), (7030, 7034, "DATE"), (7024, 7026, "PERCENT"), (6991, 6995, "DATE"), (6985, 6987, "PERCENT"), (6929, 6933, "DATE"), (6922, 6925, "PERCENT"), (6889, 6893, "DATE"), (6883, 6885, "PERCENT"), (6830, 6838, "GPE"), (6791, 6798, "PERSON"), (6700, 6702, "PERCENT"), (6690, 6699, "GPE"), (6682, 6685, "PERCENT"), (6670, 6681, "GPE"), (6656, 6659, "PERCENT"), (6642, 6646, "GPE"), (6630, 6637, "GPE"), (6620, 6628, "GPE"), (6610, 6618, "GPE"), (6599, 6608, "GPE"), (6553, 6555, "PERCENT"), (6505, 6508, "ORG"), (6469, 6476, "PERSON"), (6203, 6206, "ORG"), (6187, 6190, "ORG"), (6109, 6116, "PERSON"), (6009, 6013, "CARDINAL"), (5437, 5446, "PERCENT"), (5117, 5127, "CARDINAL"), (3957, 3964, "PERSON"), (3281, 3288, "PERSON"), (2861, 2864, "ORG"), (2848, 2855, "PERSON"), (2799, 2807, "GPE"), (2728, 2731, "ORG"), (2606, 2610, "CARDINAL"), (2222, 2226, "CARDINAL"), (1968, 1973, "DATE"), (1800, 1820, "ORG"), (1765, 1783, "DATE"), (1727, 1732, "ORDINAL"), (1670, 1683, "DATE"), (1655, 1664, "DATE"), (1602, 1626, "PERSON"), (1565, 1586, "DATE"), (1496, 1504, "GPE"), (1432, 1435, "CARDINAL"), (1287, 1289, "PERCENT"), (1056, 1063, "PERSON"), (958, 963, "DATE"), (638, 657, "PERSON"), (602, 620, "ORG"), (239, 248, "DATE"), (132, 135, "CARDINAL"), (85, 87, "PERCENT")]},
		("Khalid conceded today that he is facing pressure from leaders within his own party to step down but added he was already ‘used to the pressure’. — Picture by Choo Choy May SHAH ALAM, July 16 — Tan Sri Khalid Ibrahim today rebuffed renewed speculation that he will be made to step down as Selangor mentri besar, reiterating that he will stay on until the end of his term. Conceding that he is facing pressure from leaders within his own PKR party to step down, Khalid stressed that he will not do so and that he was already “used to the pressure”. “I think I have stated that I am going to serve until the end of my term, I have to keep my promise to the people of Selangor when I took my oath as mentri besar,” Khalid told reporters at a news conference here. “I took my oath to manage the state until the next election,” the Port Klang assemblyman asserted. The Malay Mail Online understands that while some key PAS leaders like Shah Alam MP Khalid Samad want a change in MB, both PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang and PAS secretary-general Datuk Mustafa Ali are in full support of the current Selangor MB and have made that clear last week during a private meeting. It is also understood that PR has yet to decide on who should be the next Selangor MB. While some within the pact want PKR president Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail to take over, several leaders in PKR’s Selangor chapter still prefer her deputy Azmin Ali, who is now making a renewed bid for the post by lobbying among DAP and PAS. It is understood that Hadi had given Khalid a “personal guarantee” that PAS would support him to stay as MB until the end of his term even if DAP or PKR decided otherwise. But according to an anonymous source quoted in news reports in Astro Awani and The Star yesterday, the decision to appoint Azmin as the next MB is awaiting the endorsement of Opposition Leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. The source had said that Azmin is believed to have been chosen over PKR president Wan Azizah as PAS reportedly has issues with her gender. But Azmin himself later rubbished reports of him winning DAP and PAS’s support to replace Khalid as Selangor mentri besar, saying he was not even present at a closed-door tripartite meeting where the decision was supposedly made. The PKR deputy president said yesterday that not only was he not at the meeting purportedly held on Monday night, he was not even in the country. “I have no idea. I am in Medina (Saudi Arabia). Already left KL yesterday (Monday),” Azmin told The Malay Mail Online via text message yesterday. Khalid’s position as mentri besar has remained contentious since his own party, PKR, initiated the so-called “Kajang Move” to oust him from the position in March. The move was ostensibly engineered to remove Khalid and to replace him with PKR’s de facto leader Anwar, who had intended to contest the Kajang state seat which was vacated in February. But the “Kajang move” fell through after the appellate court overturned his sodomy acquittal and sentenced him to five years in jail, days before the by-election’s nomination. Anwar has filed for an appeal against this decision. Although Anwar’s disqualification had then appeared to put to rest plans to remove Khalid, recent controversies involving the Selangor administration have prompted new agitations for his removal. Among others, these include the still-unresolved row over the seizure of bibles in the state and Khalid’s perceived partiality towards the developers of the proposed Kinrara-Damansara Expressway that is facing mounting resistance from state residents. A major barrier to Khalid’s removal was the absence of a clear candidate to replace him, with Azizah previously being touted as the most likely candidate.", "annotation_approver": "nlp_admin", {"entities": [(3684, 3690, "PERSON"), (3609, 3615, "PERSON"), (3504, 3521, "LOC"), (3435, 3441, "PERSON"), (3268, 3276, "GPE"), (2772, 2778, "PERSON"), (2564, 2570, "PERSON"), (2142, 2150, "GPE"), (1763, 1771, "ORG"), (1747, 1758, "ORG"), (1384, 1392, "GPE"), (1378, 1381, "ORG"), (1323, 1344, "PERSON"), (1250, 1258, "GPE"), (1103, 1111, "GPE"), (930, 939, "GPE"), (664, 672, "GPE"), (460, 466, "PERSON"), (288, 296, "GPE"), (193, 215, "PERSON"), (183, 190, "DATE"), (172, 181, "GPE"), (3225, 3231, "ORG"), (3151, 3156, "PERSON"), (3089, 3094, "PERSON"), (3047, 3051, "DATE"), (3027, 3037, "DATE"), (2922, 2928, "PERSON"), (2903, 2911, "DATE"), (2864, 2870, "GPE"), (2825, 2830, "PERSON"), (2803, 2806, "ORG"), (2720, 2725, "DATE"), (2674, 2685, "WORK_OF_ART"), (2644, 2647, "ORG"), (2553, 2562, "DATE"), (2503, 2508, "PERSON"), (2493, 2499, "DATE"), (2482, 2491, "DATE"), (2479, 2481, "GPE"), (2451, 2463, "GPE"), (2443, 2449, "GPE"), (2302, 2311, "DATE"), (2276, 2279, "ORG"), (2132, 2138, "PERSON"), (2107, 2112, "ORG"), (2099, 2102, "ORG"), (2046, 2051, "PERSON"), (1999, 2002, "ORG"), (1985, 1995, "PERSON"), (1971, 1974, "ORG"), (1928, 1933, "PERSON"), (1877, 1901, "PERSON"), (1859, 1869, "ORG"), (1825, 1827, "ORG"), (1807, 1812, "PERSON"), (1772, 1781, "DATE"), (1661, 1664, "ORG"), (1654, 1657, "ORG"), (1584, 1587, "ORG"), (1549, 1555, "PERSON"), (1534, 1538, "PERSON"), (1507, 1510, "ORG"), (1425, 1434, "PERSON"), (1295, 1298, "ORG"), (1140, 1149, "DATE"), (1050, 1067, "PERSON"), (1028, 1031, "ORG"), (996, 1023, "PERSON"), (982, 985, "ORG"), (973, 975, "GPE"), (943, 955, "PERSON"), (913, 916, "ORG"), (863, 880, "ORG"), (826, 836, "GPE"), (711, 717, "PERSON"), (436, 439, "ORG"), (216, 221, "DATE"), (158, 167, "PERSON"), (16, 21, "DATE")]},
		("Nurul Izzah Anwar said she has initiated legal action against the New Straits Times and Berita Harian over their reports of an alleged written confession by a former PSI executive. — File pic KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 8 — PKR’s Nurul Izzah Anwar said today that she has initiated legal action against Umno-linked papers the New Straits Times (NST) and sister publication Berita Harian over their reports quoting former PetroSaudi International (PSI) executive Xavier Andre Justo as saying that the PKR lawmaker had offered to buy stolen 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) data from him. The English-language and Malay-language dailies respectively, which are published by The New Straits Times Press (NSTP) owned by the Media Prima media group, reported Justo as saying in a written confession that he had rejected Nurul Izzah’s alleged offer to buy the information on the state investment firm for US$2 million, in the form of future government contracts should Barisan Nasional (BN) lose power, as he had wanted cash. “For the record, I categorically deny that I have ever offered US$2 million to Justo in future government contracts when the opposition came into power. I have never met him before,” Nurul Izzah said in a statement. “The NST and Berita Harian have front-paged this complete lie in a sensationalised manner, and without any regard as to whether there is any truth in the allegations. I have accordingly instructed my solicitors to commence legal proceedings against the NST and Berita Harian,” the Lembah Pantai MP and PKR vice-president added. NST also reported today Justo as saying that Clare Rewcastle-Brown, editor of London-based whistleblower site Sarawak Report, had acted as the intermediary between him and Nurul Izzah. Justo pled guilty last month in Thailand to a charge of attempting to blackmail Saudi-based PSI over purportedly incriminating documents and was sentenced to three years’ jail. Nurul Izzah stressed today that the issue was not about Justo’s theft of documents, but what the documents, together with reports by US-based paper the Wall Street Journal, Sarawak Report, and local business paper The Edge, said about corruption allegations surrounding 1MDB. “Question 1: 1MDB borrowed RM42 billion...using sovereign guarantees of the Malaysian government. What have they got to show for it? “Question 2: How did more than US$1 billion belonging to the PetroSaudi-1MDB joint venture end up in Jho Low’s companies’ accounts? “Question 3: The RM2.6 billion (US$700 million), which was deposited in the prime minister’s personal account. Was it really from the so-called donor from the Middle East or was it the 1MDB billions returning full circle?” she said. Nurul Izzah said such questions could be answered by Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s bank accounts and the 1MDB money trail and that this was why PKR had filed for the discovery of documents in its suit against the prime minister over allegations of financial misappropriation involving 1MDB. Among others, the suit seeks access to Najib’s monthly bank statements from 2009, receipt of RM2.6 billion from Tanore Finance Corp into his personal accounts, receipt of RM42 million from SRC International Sdn Bhd into his personal accounts, documents, minutes, correspondence, records and agreements on SRC’s RM4 billion loan from Retirement Fund Incorporated, as well as all monthly bank statements for 1MDB and its subsidiaries accounts both in and out of the country. The Wall Street Journal reported last July that almost US$700 million was moved around companies linked to 1MDB before it ended up in Najib’s personal bank accounts in March 2013, two months before the 13th general election.

		("Shaariibuu Setev arrives at the Shah Alam Hight Court January 25, 2019. ― Picture by Yusof Mat Isa SHAH ALAM, Jan 25 — The father to slain Mongolian model Altantuya Shaariibuu told the High Court today that his daughter had travelled to Malaysia in October 2006 to meet an individual identified as “Razak”. Testifying as the second witness in his family’s RM100 million civil lawsuit against the Malaysian government, Altantuya’s convicted killers and the man she had an affair with, Shaariibuu Setev said his daughter met him at their home between October 7 and 8, 2006 prior to her departure to Kuala Lumpur. Shaariibuu, 69, who is a retired professor from the Mongolian National University, however said he did not know how ‘Razak’ looked like at that time. “All that she told me was Razak. I do not know which Razak, Abdul Razak Baginda or Najib Razak,” he said through Mongolian interpreter Enkhjin Batbilig under questioning from his lawyer Ramkarpal Singh. Abdul Razak was a political analyst and had headed a think tank called the Malaysian Strategic Research Centre based in Kuala Lumpur previously. He was also an adviser to Datuk Seri Najib Razak when the latter was defence minister (2000 to 2008) and deputy prime minister (between January 2004 and April 2009) before taking over as prime minister from April 3, 2009 to May last year. Najib has repeatedly denied knowing Altantuya or that he had any part in her death. Shaariibuu said Altantuya, fondly known as “Amina”, had gone to the toilet midway during their conversation, leaving her luggage with him when her phone rang. “I opened her bag and I saw a photo of two men with her. I asked her specifically who they were because my daughter was in it. “To which she answered these are the people she was going to meet in Malaysia,” he testified. Shaariibuu said he was aware of his daughter’s frequent visit to Malaysia and had asked Altantuya if she had any reason to visit Malaysia so often during their meeting at his home in Mongolia in October 2006. “She told me she was in a relationship with a ‘big’ man whose name was Baginda and that the trip was important because she wanted to arrange medical help for her handicapped son who was born with cerebral palsy,” he said. He said he also later discovered among Altantuya’s possession a flight ticket purchased by a ‘Razak’ dated March 23, 2005 and jewellery receipt from Habib worth RM11,300 that was dated March 4, 2005. “I also discovered a letter from Abdul Razak Baginda dated March 2, 2006 addressed to Altantuya for US$18,000. “It was not signed by him but was signed by Altantuya in acknowledgement of the said funds,” he said. Also present were Abdul Razak’s lawyer Kuan Chee Foo and senior federal counsel Norinna Bahadun for the government. The hearing resumes Monday morning with the testimonial hearing of Shaariibuu. Altantuya’s parents Shaariibuu and Altantsetseg Sanjaa, and Altantuya’s two sons had on June 4, 2007 filed the civil lawsuit to claim compensation for the mental shock and psychological trauma they suffered over her death. However, Altantuya’s younger son, 15-year-old Alatanshagai Munkhtukga, was removed as plaintiff when he died in 2017. In the lawsuit where Altantuya’s family is seeking RM100 million as compensation, Sirul Azhar Umar, Azilah Hadri, Abdul Razak and the government of Malaysia were named as defendants. Sirul and Azilah were convicted by the High Court in 2009 of killing Altantuya. They succeeded in overturning their conviction at the Court of Appeal in 2013, but the Federal Court in 2015 restored their conviction and sentenced them to death. Abdul Razak who was accused of abetting the two former police officers in her murder was acquitted. Sirul fled to Australia after the death sentence and is currently under detention there as Australian laws do not allow extradition of anyone to a country where they will be killed.

		("A view of one building in Tanjung Sutera Resort. — Picture courtesy of tripadvisor KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 17 — Putrajaya’s unprecedented move to strip a Singaporean man of his permanent residence (PR) status for allowing a group of Buddhist tourists to meditate in a Muslim prayer room at his resort, was excessive and unnecessary, several lawyers said today. The lawyers also warned the federal government that it had set itself up for a potential lawsuit, should the man choose to challenge the revocation. Eric Paulsen, co-founder and advisor of legal group, Lawyers for Liberty, told The Malay Mail Online that the government’s announcement today seemed to be done in “extreme haste” and is an irrational move. “Because what (the home minister] had done is punishing the resort operator, through the back door. “So now even before he is found guilty, the authorities have found ways through the back door to punish him,” he said over the phone. The holiday resort owner in Sedili Besar, near Kota Tinggi, was released on police bail yesterday, after being remanded for four days to facilitate investigations into him allowing the resort’s surau to be used for a Buddhist religious ceremony. Johor police had said that the investigation papers of the case were, however, being finalised and had yet to be submitted to the public prosecutor for further action. Today, Home Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi announced that the Singaporean’s PR has been revoked, effective immediately. Paulsen said the home ministry’s action has a serious affect on the Singaporean, and that this matter should not be taken lightly. “He should at least be afforded the opportunity to be heard. “It is now open for him to challenge this decision in court,” the lawyer said. Civil liberties lawyer Syahredzan Johan also deemed the home minister’s action as “excessive and unnecessary”. “We have to remember this person has not been charged in court for anything and he has not been tried or found guilty of anything. “When the government revokes his PR status what the government is essentially doing is punishing him before anything has been proven against him, even before he is allowed to defend himself,” he told The Malay Mail Online over the phone. “They should have charged the person in court and try to prove the case against him, instead of going about this way because this is arbitrary. “This is excessive and arbitrary and disregarding his right to be heard,” he said. Syahredzan said the government should consider the repercussions from such a harsh decision. “If the government wants to encourage people to come to Malaysia, here we have this person coming to Malaysia to operate a resort, when most Malaysians have gone to Singapore to work, we need these kind of people to work and invest in the country. “We cannot have a culture of arbitrary punishment without allowing the person to defend themselves,” he said. He acknowledged that the government has the jurisdiction to revoke one’s PR visa but he said those powers must be exercised accordingly. “At least (the resort operator] should try to assert his rights in court rather than just allow something like this to happen,” he said. Paulsen also said that the decision today will affect foreigners considering to have businesses here or foreigners whom might consider Malaysia as a second home. “The government must a take a more measured approach in handling these cases against Islam even though we understand the government’s position that Islam is the official religion. “This decision has a serious repercussion in terms of economic interests, investments, tourism and how the world sees Malaysia. “I urge the authorities to not overreact and act emotionally, and to look through the rules and regulation to provide justice,” he said. Datuk Ambiga Sreenevasan, a prominent civil rights activist and former Bar Council president expressed her shock over the Home Minister’s announcement “Shocking move!

		("Bangladesh would consider an out-of-court settlement with a bank in the Philippines over $81 million stolen from its accounts in New York by hackers who wired the money to Manila, Bangladesh central bank officials said on Thursday. In one of the world's biggest cyber heists, the hackers stole the Bangladesh Bank money held at the New York Fed in February 2016 using fraudulent orders on the SWIFT payments system and sent it to Rizal Commercial Banking Corp . From there, it disappeared into the casino industry in the Philippines. No one has been charged for the heist despite an international investigation and two years of finger-pointing among Bangladesh, Philippines, the Fed and SWIFT. There is an option before us to settle the issue out of court, a senior official at Bangladesh's central bank told Reuters. The official, who declined to be identified, cited as a precedent an out-of-court settlement in February reached by Ecuador's Banco del Austro and Wells Fargo over a 2015 cyber heist. Bangladesh's Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith on Thursday met Carlos Dominguez, Finance Secretary of the Philippines, on the sidelines of a four-day annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank in Manila to discuss the cyber heist, said two senior central bank officials close to the issue. Bangladesh is yet to take legal action but had planned a suit to recover $66 million.
